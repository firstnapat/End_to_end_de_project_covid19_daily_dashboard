My credit union requires a copy of the title so that they can confirm that no one else is on the car title. Westlake has been refusing to provide the information to my credit union. Westlake said they require the request come directly from my credit union and not myself. When my credit union requested the information, Westlake said they would provide it in a couple of days. The required documentation never showed up. Now Westlake says they will not provide the information needed to refinance my vehicle as i battle this XXXX and can no longer work. It has now been over 30 days and my refinancing attempt must start all over again, which means running my credit again. This is grossly effecting my fiances and my credit reporting since i now have multiple inquiries that should not be necessary.',\n",

I got this car that is work like XXXX and my loan is XXXX. Ive made every payment via auto deduction for two years and they cant even answer me why my loan was sold to US auto. I feel like without the option to pay off my warranty, Im still going to be paying interest on it for the entirety of the loan. I cant get the car refinance because the car is not worth what it was sold to me for. So Im stuck in an upside down loan, they knew I was desperate and had become a single parent very suddenly and needed to provide for my daughter. They keep selling my loan to collect fees, they said they do it to the best paying customers they have a list other lenders can pick from to purchase but in the contract it says assign and they said it was reassigned when really it was sold so they can collect a portion of the fee.

I promptly made the payment to the dealership and was pick up again by Car Financial Services. I made XXXX 's payment on time. At that point, I had my payment date to match my VA compensation payment date. In XXXX of XXXX, I made my payment over the telephone. At that time, I asked the customer representative why i was being reported to the credit bureaus. He informed that they report it ever month, and condescendingly said that i must use XXXX XXXX. He made it sound like was I ignorant and did not know what I was talking about. I had the same conversation several times throughout the past year. \\nI informed most of the customer representative I talked to that my first loan was there and closed, but the second was not there. I was always informed that it is automatically reported. \\nIn XXXX of this year, I wanted to try to get my truck refinanced to lower my interest rate. Finally someone agreed with me and saw that it was not being report and told me what to do. \\nI preceded to get a hold of the credit dispute team for Car Financial Services. I then got a letter in the mail from them stating that I was right it is no where to be fold on any of the credit bureaus. I requested that that it be posted and i was informed that the account ; as far as, the credit bureaus is concerned my account was closed and could not be reported. Why can they report one account a decide not to report the other. \\nI asked why it was closed and not being reported, i was informed that it was done last XXXX. Also, Car Financial Services didn't would not to post it. \\nYou see I wanted to accomplish 3 things. One. of my goal was to get a bad XXXX new truck that was done. the second goal was to try to improve my credit rating and get refinanced. Hoping that would improve my score enough to use my VA loan to buy my Mother 's property for her as a present. this was the third and finally thing. Now knowing that I can't accomplish any of things, I am some what XXXX. I don't remember being told that the account was never going to be reported. \\nI then was informed by the credit reporting team that they didn't have to tell me and it was their choice to report it or not. Which i found out to be true, I can't get my truck refinance and i will have to find another way to improve my score. The other option is to go ahead and file bankruptcy and start all over!\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"In XXXX of 2019, I called Santander Consumer inquiring about refinancing. I was informed that they do not refinance by the representative and shortly after that I started receiving missed payment notifications on my credit report. My credit score started off in the low XXXX 's and now is in the mid XXXX 's. The main reason as to why I called about refinancing was because my interest rate is high. I have worked diligently to change that and I have. I have called them on several different occasions on this matter but have had no response on this particular matter. No one will refinance me now because I show have recent late payments. I have paid my bill the same way since starting the loan. I never received any mail regarding in delinquencies on my account primarily because they have been reluctant to put real address on any of my mail. The dealership, Santander Consumer, and the credit bureaus all have been made aware of my address being incorrect. No entity has corrected it yet.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'To whom it may concern, Re : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Auto loan financed with Navy Federal Credit Union This is a formal complaint against Navy Federal Credit Unions Collateral Control dept. My husband and I had refinanced his truck through Navy Federal Credit Union XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX  at a much lower interest rate. At this time, we agreed to the terms and conditions of presenting a new title to Navy Federal with them listed as the new lien holder. In order to complete this we had to pay off the present loan with XXXXXXXX XXXX  and they would send us a lien release to take to the local agency to apply for the new title. I waited over a month for this to come in the mail and it never showed up. I called XXXX XXXX to follow up on the status of this. Their title department advised me they sent this to the corporate branch for Navy federal in Virginia. I was sent a letter and received a phone call from Navy Federal to bring a copy of our title up to the branch to have them scan into their system. At this time, I took off of work to go into the bank and have them scan the title. The title we had still name XXXX XXXX  as the lien holder which I explained to the lady at the XXXX XXXX OK branch, what was going on. She said thats okay if they have the lien, they are able to file for the new title on our behalf for a small fee. I okayed them to charge me the fee so that I wouldnt have to take more time off of work to get this completed. Another month went by I receive another letter from Navy saying they needed the new title. I took off of work again and drove to the bank in XXXX XXXX and called the customer service number to speak with someone in the title dept at Navy Federal who said she was noting the account really well of all our efforts and could see my prior calls that we are trying to resolve this matter and someone would call me back. I never received a returned call. When I got the Navy Federal, they lady said they didnt have a copy of the title. I explained once again what was going on, she apologized and asked that I give her the title to scan into the system again. She assured me this would be taken care of and she could see in the file they did have the lien release from XXXXXXXX XXXX Almost 2 more months went by I heard nothing until I receive an email and call from Navy Federal ( see email attached ) This email is advising me our loan interest rate will change if we do not take care of the issue. At this time, I called Navy federal again spoke with someone in title dept who said it may be best that I go up to branch to resolve this matter. I took off of work again, drove to XXXX XXXX Ok ( 40 mins away ) sat down with a branch representative who advised the lien release they have on file from XXXX XXXX was never signed therefore it was not valid. I asked her to call XXXX XXXX with me in the branch, she did ; I spoke with the XXXX XXXX title rep gave permission for them to speak with Navy Federal. At this time the Navy federal rep explained to them the copy they sent was not signed they need a new copy mailed out. She told them the send the copy to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX Attn : XXXX. She assured me they were going to send a new signed lien release out right away. Navy Federal may ask me to authorize them request the new title once they receive the new lien release. I left and went back to work ( see attached letter ). Yesterday XX/XX/XXXX I receive a letter from the collateral Control dept at Navy Federal stating my loan no longer qualifies for a collateral loan and has been converted to an unsecured loan with an increased interest rate of over 11 % more than our current auto loan at 3.99 %. This new rate increased my payment by more than {$100.00} which at this point I have incurred financial damages and want someone held accountable. This is unacceptable business practice. I immediately called Navy Federal and requested an escalation to a manager to fix this. They advised me they would have to call me back within 24 hours and that they have put in a request to hold the account, but I may still be charged, and they would not refund me any excess monies. This request can take 3-5 days to process. At this time, they were made aware my next move would be to put in a formal complaint to the CFPB. The next business day XX/XX/XXXX I receive a voicemail from Navy Federal, but my phone does not ring. They leave a message dont say their name or reason for the call. They provided me a generic callback number of XXXX. I call right away and get the customer service rep on the phone verify who I am, she says she sees who called me and why, but would not give me her direct number or name and put me on hold to see if she could get her on the line. After two attempts she comes back saying the lady is not available and put in a escalation request to have her call me right back. I should get a call back in about 30 minutes to 1 hour. This was at XXXX the time is not XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I still have not received a returned phone call. I called XXXXXXXX XXXX request to speak with a manager in their titling dept and explained the reason for my call. Was transferred XXXX who advised me they sent a second copy of the lien release ( signed ) on XX/XX/XXXX to Navy Federal the address they requested to the Attention of XXXX. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX advised me she could send another copy overnight certified with tracking needing a signature if I could tell her a physical address for Navy Federal and a persons name to make it attention to. This information I do not have. I have requested XXXX XXXX send the copy to my address, however Im not sure they will do that. I advised them I would take the release up to Navy Federal Branch in XXXX XXXX myself and handle this. I would appreciate your prompt resolution of this matter.',\n",

Fast forward to XXXX when my XXXX XXXX  fianc and I bought our first vehicle together. Our credit was not in good shape and there was a lot I didnt know about back then such as disputes. Capital One offered us a 19.04 % interest rate auto loan. We have been paying on it monthly since XXXX of XXXX and its XXXX near impossible to refinance, that exceptional payment history doesnt mean anything apparently for him. Its so disheartening because I told him how easy it was for me to refinance and I think he didnt believe me at first. Its wrong to take advantage of people like this.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'XX/XX/2020 XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX XXXX : Auto Loan # XXXX VIA EMAiL : XXXX To Whom it May Concern : Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been trying to expedite the purchase of my XXXX XXXX XXXX from Lexus to XXXX  XXXX XXXX. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. Here are the details. \\n\\nLoan approved through XXXX  XXXX XXXX Sent ALL requested paperwork to XXXX  XXXX XXXX including : Lessees Odomotor Disclosure Statement Lessee/Purchaser Acknowledgement and the Disclaimer of Warranties Authorization for Payoff and Title Processing Cashiers check to cover down payment and taxes Numerous phone calls have been originated by me to both XXXX  XXXX XXXX and Lexus on the following dates in an attempt to resolve : Lexus : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX, ( XXXX, XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX  XXXX  XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX, ( XXXX ) XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  ), XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) ;  XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ), XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, there was a three way call between Lexus, XXXX and me the required documents were faxed twice by XXXX  XXXX XXXX and mailed regular mail by XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Lexus and spoke to XXXX who informed me that they had not received any of the documents and in fact, had sent the two checks payable to XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amounts of {$22000.00} ( Consumer Credit Check ) and {$6100.00} ( Cashiers Check ). \\n\\nI was further informed by XXXX at Lexus that I should void said checks and resend from my personal funds in the amount totaling {$28000.00} and include the documents that have been line itemed above. Oddly, Lexus faxed me the documents that they claim were not received in time. \\n\\nSince this did not sound accurate to me, I once again called XXXX  XXXX XXXX to see if I could resolve. \\n\\nImmediately after hanging up with Lexus, I reached back to XXXX  XXXX XXXX Auto Loan Department. After a 45 minute wait, numerous discussions wit XXXX ( who was also attempting to find the right person/department ) I was put back in touch with XXXX, a manager of the department who Id spoken with on XX/XX/XXXX as referenced above. \\n\\nI explained the situation, XXXX referred to the prior months worth of notes and asked me to provide this detailed account of my issue. \\n\\nAt this point, she is as exasperated as I am. I have two checks, a bunch of documents and no answers. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX -XXXX  who referred me back to XXXX who referred me to XXXX who referred me back to original loan officer XXXX XXXX . I left a message for XXXX. Note still unresolved On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alert that Lexus was reporting me for unpaid lease invoices fir 3 months! \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , re-explained everything again. She didnt know how to handle and was submitting an escalation request to funding dept. she said I would hear from someone in 2-3 business days. As of today, I have heard from no one from XXXX  XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, Lexus Financial called. XXXX wanted to know where the documents were. He reported to me that Lexus notated account that no documents had been received. And furthermore, they would not address the erroneous mark on my credit until this matter was resolved. \\n\\nI re-explained the history. He put me in hold and When he came back on the line informed me that Lexus had the documents. I should send the checks to Lexus and provided me wirh a mailing address. \\n\\nNow, the next problem is that the amounts to Lexus are not correct. Money is due back to me from XXXX XXXX XXXX since Ive been paying installment loan since XXXX. \\n\\nI have to request reimbursement back from XXXX  XXXX XXXX Can someone please expedite this to someone who can help me resolve this issue? \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'At this point I am convinced that I am dealing with a fraudulent situation and that I was lied to in what was described as a loan transfer which was, in fact, a refinance of an auto loan that had been reduced to principal. \\n\\nI was approached by a Westlake representative offering me a \" thank you offer for maintaining a pristine payment history \\'\\'. The offer was an incentive of {$2000.00} to transfer my account to another division for management and that while I would only incur interest on the {$2000.00} only. I asked upside down and backwards that this transfer would not incur any additional interest over the course of 3 days. Every single time I was told that it would be a transfer only, that it would not have any effect on my credit report and that I would only continue paying on principal ; my payment of $ XXXX/mo went up.\\n\\nYesterday I find out that I had actually re-financed my loan and agreed to paying an additional {$11000.00} in interest. There is no sane person on EARTH that would agree to paying double interest on a loan?? Unless it was buried in the contract ... .and lied to horrifically and repeatedly.\\n\\nWestlake destroyed my entire credit history ; reporting that I owe two loans to them for a total amount of {$33000.00}. Within their process they have deleted my entire credit history, showing my old account as closed, which should be paid off if this was actually a re-finance correct? They can\\'t seem to see the problem on their end ( further instance of fraud )? \\n\\nMy last conversation with Westlake I requested a transcript of my conversations with them in association to this transaction and was told it would only be released for legal reasons. I explained that it was for legal purposes and was told they would not release it. I got them to admit on tape that they were denying me access to my account information and contact history. \\n\\nApparently this \\'transfer \\' company has a different name yet appears to be operating under the Westlake banner. That said, this certainly points to fraud- why would I have two accounts unless ... ..I do... and that would explain a lot. One is real and one is fraud. doubling the interest charged through lies, deception and manipulation. Informatively, in my reporting them to the XXXX  I found multiple complaints of the exact same circumstance of being ticked into re-financing a loan.\\n\\nI have reached out 3 times to the CEO via email since last month with no response. He did direct his Compliance Officer to respond to my initial email and I was treated like a child, talked down to and incredulousness that I had any concerns whatsoever. He basically said ; it\\'s your fault and live with it. \\n\\nI appreciate you taking the time to review this information and I hope you an find out what is going on- thank you, XXXX',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Hello, I'm trying to get in touch with someone on a corporate level about the XXXX XXXX dealership located at XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. I originally financed a pre-owned XXXX XXXX XXXX which I was told had just been traded in earlier that day. The XXXX experienced a pre-mature timing chain problem which corporate worked out a resolution with for me. Shortly after, the turbo went out and I was told there was engine damage and the dealership told me it wasn't worth repairing and to trade it in for a new XXXX XXXX ( XXXX model at the time ). I strongly believe the dealership did not fully inspect the XXXX before selling it to me because they wanted a quick sale. As a result, I have been paying off the loan through XXXX for a lemon vehicle that I only got around XXXX miles of use out of for a $ XXXX vehicle and a {$4000.00} down payment. I feel completely robbed as a result of this transaction when I was seeking an economy vehicle as a working student. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe XXXX experience aside, I was told that the trade-in for the XXXX XXXX could be refinanced in one year to lower the payments. I am currently paying {$530.00} a month and am a full-time working student whose job requires a working vehicle. I felt I had no choice but to trade-in because the service center told me the XXXX was not worth fixing as the costs would exceed the value. \\n\\n\\nSeveral unethical issues are apparent at this dealership besides the initial sale of the XXXX. Firstly, the XXXX XXXX had a recall that I immediately scheduled an appointment for upon receiving the notification. The dealership gave me back the vehicle without a working radio and the steering wheel buttons were entirely unusable. I immediately contacted them to resolve the issue and was told that they needed to order a new part. This was in XXXX of this year. I brought the XXXX in to the dealership over four times and called over 10 times over the course of seven months -- each time the service center claimed they had the part and upon dropping the vehicle off, they didn't have it and sent me home. I took that time off from work and wasted countless hours waiting for the problem to be resolved based on false information from the service center. I strongly believe the dealership continuously forgot to order the part throughout that seven month time frame and instead of admitting it, wasted my time as a customer. The final time I took it in they told me they needed to keep it for a few days because they had to order the part ( again ). The problem is finally resolved, after seven-eight months, however this simple recall has cost me a substantial amount of income due to being told to bring it in and them not having the part, telling me they need to  order it still and waiting at the dealership. \\n\\n\\nSecondly, when I initially bought the XXXX  I was told that I receive free oil changes for life at this location. The service advisors claim there is no record of this. This was unethical and a blatant lie from the sale 's associates to get a sale. The service advisors also offered me a discount towards my next service if I took a survey and answered all of the questions according to a screenshot they texted me that had the answers all filled in in the multiple choice bubbles. I did not take the survey as sending a customer correct answers to boost their rating is unethical. \\n\\n\\nFinally, I went back to the dealership the other week after a sale 's associate called me ( I didn't contact them first ) and said that he could refinance the car to get me a lower interest rate. Instead, they tried to get me to trade-in, again, after claiming they couldn't refinance after all. I spent five hours at the dealership just to deal with more  roundabouts from XXXX XXXX and unethical business practices. After I declined trading in I was told by the finance manager that I could take out a Nissan credit card to pay off a projected {$7000.00}  to make it possible to refinance the XXXX XXXX  or voluntarily surrender it to the dealership and take out a new loan on a new XXXX XXXX. Again -- I went in to refinance as I was told when I had first bought the vehicle I would be able to do in one years time. Due to them reaching out first, I assumed they were following up with that promise.\\n\\nI know this has been a long email and a lot to take in. I'm a working student who lives on less than {$30000.00} per year and came in to this dealership for a working vehicle. I have lost countless days of work, time, and dealt with false information and unethical  recommendations after they sold me a lemon, refused to take any sort of accountability, continue to hold me accountable to that negative equity ( I'm paying off a car that I couldn't use still to this day ), and  continued to waste my time with the recall for the XXXX and false refinancing promises. One of the associates claimed he wouldn't make  any money on me trading my XXXX XXXX for a different model and that it would only count as a sale for the store because it was going bankrupt. I don't understand why a business would even tell a customer that. \\n\\n\\nPlease look at my loan history and see how much I have paid your company for ONE working economy vehicle. I have already paid that, and then some and yet I'm stuck with ridiculously high payments on a car I was coerced into getting while paying off the loan for a lemon they sold me. I urge XXXX corporate to be accountable on behalf of their XXXX location and work out a fair loan renegotiation with me based on everything I have endured as a result of this unethical location. I have been accountable as a customer ; it's their turn.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/XXXX My grandmother XXXX XXXX in XXXX California from a XXXX. Around the same time her husband, my grandfather was struggling to recover from XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I drove from XXXX MI, where I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, r to XXXX California due to the double family emergency. My XXXX pay for my auto loan with Chase Auto Finance was due XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI was not able to attend to the financial matter wit Chase Auto Finance until XX/XX/XXXX, once my grandmother was XXXX and my grandfather had been released from the hospital to return home. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase Auto finance requesting a temporary cessation in payments due to the double family emergency. The customer service representative stated that an easier alternative to the temporary cessation would be to agree to a \" Promise to pay \\'\\' byXX/XX/XXXX. I informed him that I would like to use the cessation in payments since I did not know the exact date off-hand in XX/XX/XXXX that my next stipend check or payroll payment as a XXXX would be issued. I offered to provide the gentlemen a copy of my tax transcripts for the past four ( 4 ) years, a copy of my contract with my university regarding funding for the duration that I remain a XXXX student, a copy of the program from my grandmother \\'s XXXX, and a sworn affidavit to that effect. \\n\\nThe customer service representative then asked me if all of that was going on how it was that I was able to afford to pay ALL my mother bills. I explained again that I \\'m a XXXX XXXX XXXX AND XXXX. He stated that he \\'d never heard of the term before and that he \\'d never heard of different payment dates as a XXXX and a XXXX XXXX. He then stated he would not be able to approve the payment extension himself because he did not want to be \" personally responsible if/when after the payment extension I would n\\'t be able to pay my bill. \\'\\' He entered the explanation as such and then handed it off to a supervisor for approval. He told me to call back around the XX/XX/XXXX to check the status of my request. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called back and received the news that the extension had been denied, and the reason was verbatim the explanation that was given by the customer service representative on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked to speak with a supervisor regarding the explanation and the conclusion that I did not have the ability to pay my auto loan. I spoke with a supervisor named XXXX that identified herself with the ID number XXXX. She explained verbatim the reason for the denial. I explained to her that I needed clarification on the reason for the denial -- she refused to provide one, except to explain that it was for the exact same reason that the gentlemen on the XX/XX/XXXX did n\\'t want to extend the payment. She stated that it was the position of Chase Auto Finance that my present situation is not temporary and therefore there was no reason to believe that I would be able to continue making payments on my vehicle. \\n\\nI asked for an written explanation for the denial of payment extension. XXXX refused to provide one stating that because the terms of my original loan had not been modified, no written correspondence would be provided. The lady concluded the conversation by reminding me that because I had not yet paid the payment on the account that even if I walked into a local branch that was open and paid in cash on the XXXX day past-due, that they would report my payment as being thirty ( 30 ) days past-due. This sort of comment seems entirely putative in nature. \\n\\nA renegotiation, or request for modification of loan terms is based upon a financial assessment, and would seemingly constitute a financial evaluation akin to a credit inquiry, taking into account payment history, credit score, and other internal and external factors. However, Chase Auto Finance has refused to provide ANY written explanation and has made it very clear that they will to be providing one. This seems contrary to the practices I \\'ve observed with other banking institutions as the others I deal with prefer all business correspondence to be in writing. \\n\\n\\nNow, the sheer reasoning for the denial is unsound and questionable, as I \\'ve paid on the auto loan for the past five and a half years, dropping the loan amount from the origination amount of just over 21 thousand dollars to just over 2500 dollars. That is, through total compensation over the loan term, I \\'ve paid off 9/10 of the loan. Therefore there is no reason to believe that with a prior income before returning to school of well into six-figures, and with total compensation as a XXXX XXXX and XXXX at or near six-figures, evidenced through the contractual documents, tax transcripts, and payroll information I offered, that there should be any issue. \\n\\nBased upon the first representative \\'s comments in the computer system and conversation on XX/XX/XXXX, it would therefore appear that Chase Auto Finance is scheming, hedging on the fact that I can not make future payments on the vehicle, since to repossess the vehicle and resell it because its resale value is higher than what is currently owed on the vehicle. \\n\\nTo conclude, I had dual family emergencies that has prevented me from pay my bill on-time. I explained this to chase and requested a payment extension. The first Chase representative was willing to extend a promise-to-pay for XX/XX/XXXX, until he understood that I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX. He explained to me that he \\'d never heard of a XXXX XXXX XXXX before, and stated he did n\\'t want to extend or modify the loan repayment schedule because he believed that I did n\\'t have the ability to pay ANY of my current debt obligations. He annotated this information and his viewpoint and subsequently sent it to \" management \\'\\' for approval. \\n\\nChase \" management \\'\\' subsequently conducted a financial evaluation to process my loan modification request for a one-month cessation in payments to allow me to return to MI. Chase \" management \\'\\' concluded that I did n\\'t have the ability to pay ANY of my financial obligations. The supervisor I subsequently spoke with named XXXX with ID XXXX refused to provide any written explanation for the denial and repeated the assertion that I did not have the ability to pay the auto loan, or ANY of my obligations, despite of copious amounts of documentation I was willing to provide that suggested this was not the case, to include tax transcripts, pay schedule for stipend AND employee payroll, prior employee payroll and income documents, and contractual documents regarding funding for me as a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nChase seems to be unwilling to provide temporary relief for customers who lost relatives and are trying to keep accounts current while dealing with the loss, customers who previously demonstrated ability to pay that offer supporting documentation, and customers who have a payment history of paying down a loans with them. It would appear as well that Chase Auto Finance is scheming, hedging on the fact that I can not make future payments on the vehicle to repossess the vehicle and resell it because its resale value is higher than what is currently owed on the vehicle.',\n",

I can not trade in my car or sell it since my ex husband is still on the registration. There is no Manger to talk to and they just keep putting in emails saying I will get a call back and never do. Capital one says they don't except electronic titles but there is nothing I can do.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"When I purchased the vehicle XX/XX/XXXX I originally financed it through XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One refinanced the loan and paid off XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX immediately sent the Lien Release letter to Capital One as the new security interest holder. Capital One has since sat on the title paperwork, and as of today XX/XX/XXXX still not send the paperwork to the Oregon DMV so the DMV can process my title and send me the registration and plates so I can drive my vehicle without a temporary trip permit. Oregon DMV granted me a 90 day trip permit back on XX/XX/XXXX so that I could drive my vehicle while they awaited the paperwork from Capital One including the Lien Release letter from XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from the Oregon DMV stating that they were still awaiting the lien release so they could finish processing my title and registration. I immediately contacted Capital One who confirmed they had the lien release from XXXX, and would send the requested copy to the Oregon DMV. On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up on the status of this request with Capital One, and was told that they had not yet sent the required document to Oregon DMV, but they had just sent the paperwork over to their mail room whom would process and send the paperwork via XXXX and email me a tracking number. As of today, since I had still not seen a tracking number via email, I again called Capital One to follow-up on the status. The representative again told me that it had not yet been sent, but that she showed that it was in the mail room, and confirmed I was still supposed to receive a tracking number once it is sent. I called and spoke to the Oregon DMV asking what I am to do once the current trip permit expires on XX/XX/XXXX since Capital One hasn't yet sent them the lien release, and since due to the COVID backlog, the process could still take a couple months once received, for me to finally get my registration and plates so I can drive without a trip permit. The Oregon DMV stated that they do not provide additional trip permits, and that I need to continue to hassle Capital One to do their job and get them the paperwork that they should have already sent months ago when the lien release was originally received by Capital One from XXXX XXXX. Capital One is now causing me undue hardship and stress in having to take time out of work to call them continuously to make sure they're doing their job. Please help make them do their job and get the paperwork to the Oregon DMV.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Earlier this year before Covid I had an issue with my XXXX XXXX XXXX  which required me to take it into the shop to have some warranty work completed on it. It was covered after going through some hoops which I get it warranty work no one gets paid for it directly. My issue upon this situation was that the part that had to be ordered came from DriveTime and/or XXXX home office located in AZ. I was told it was remanufactured or like new. Wasn't able to see and verify parts after replacement because they had to be sent back to AZ. Under my warranty contract with them and XXXX XXXX it does state thats in line with the parts they can replace on any vehicle per the agreement. My issue was I was out of vehicle for almost a week because of the time it took for parts to come in and upon asking for a loaner vehicle said the billable hours didn't meet their requirement of reimbursement and I could get loaner any try to get it back but no a promise for reimbursement. Asked on several occasions that I wanted proof of what parts had been replaced and was told by all of them that it is something they have to prove to me per the contract. Fast Forward my needs have changed and am currently looking at getting out of this vehicle and getting into something that better reflects what I need at this time. No dealership will take the trade because of the high interest rate and more money down needed to make the deal happen. I get that but Drivetime/XXXX won't take the trade in as well at all regardless of money I need to put down. I was told they don't take their cars back on trade and/or refinance current loans even if they still make more money on new one. I am tired of the pure bad business practices these companies are allowed to get away with. My previous vehicle I had gotten from them had to be bought back from me after many battles that I eventually proved was a flood damaged vehicle. They couldn't give me the money I had paid into that vehicle being a XXXX XXXX XXXX because I had paid for time I used it and was only given my original down payment. These companies being able to do all of this and the consumer just out of luck? I had also asked what had come of the vehicle bought back from me did they sell it to another sucker. I have filed complaints after complaints but they are still in business doing same shady used car sales. There was now ay my 1st car should have been sold to me let alone past State Inspection. I am filing a class action lawsuit against DriveTIme and/or XXXX for unfair Business Sale tactics and Fraud any help would be appreciated.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I work for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and have been working diligently to help our member, XXXX XXXX pay off XXXX XXXX XXXX for his XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX vehicle was recovered on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX, their office is located in XXXX, NC. This was due to failure to provide proof of full coverage insurance. The vehicle had full coverage, but XXXX states they did not have record of it. XXXX phone was stolen in the months preceding this incident, so they were unable to contact him by phone and he has not received any notification by mail regarding the problem. The recovering agent advised that he had the opportunity to seize the collateral on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, but he waited to do so until the weekend. This resulted in XXXX XXXX not being able to take any action until two days later when the office was opened, and likely accruing storage fees during this time. Had the agent recovered on Monday when he stated he was to pick up, XXXX could have handled the situation same day with no delay or accrued fees. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX offered to pay XXXX XXXX XXXX in full in order to release collateral to our member. They were advised of severity of him being without transportation and that all we needed was the amount of payoff, as well as recovery expenses to be paid before they would release it. XXXX began calling the office on Monday at XXXX. He gave oral and written authorization for XXXX to speak with XXXX, and we have been more than compliant in every request they have made. Their office has been extremely negligent and disrespectful in trying to resolve, including hanging up on me when calling for follow-up information. I have provided every document they have requested via fax, email, and by phone. The manager, XXXX XXXX, has screened my calls on multiple occasions and has refused to be compliant despite our efforts. XXXX signed an authorization to release information to us, as well as a notarized POA, along with his DL photo, proof of insurance showing XXXX as lienholder with the lienholder address they provided to him. This business uses predatory lending to take advantage of customers who arent aware how badly they are being taken advantage of, and they have basically refused to accept payment for the balance of loan. They are not reporting to credit bureaus and continue to charge fees along with unfair interest rates that are unfair and deceptive, I am sure it is a subprime loan. There has been no evidence of good-faith business practices here, nothing short of illegal, theyve been immoral and unethical to say the least. I have requested an itemized statement as to what is owed to verify that there has not been evidence of loan churning and they have refused. Every time a document has been requested, we have complied, and then they give a different request to comply with, which again, we provided as requested. After escalating from the local branch to Customer Relations Coordinator, I received noticed that they were waiting on another bill from the towing company before they could give me the total amount owed. The tow company had already advised they had sent the bill to the office. They provided me with an additional copy nevertheless that I forwarded to XXXX. However the local office advised they could not provide payoff today, but had to wait until following day to do so. There is three hours of driving time needed for him to go to their office in XXXX and the storage facility in XXXX. Hes already made arrangements with his employer to take time off every day trying to resolve this, putting him in a tough position with employer as well. As a lender and consumer alike, I have been more than offended by the practice with this office.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I had my van loan financed with ALLY Financial with an ACH debit from my credit Union. My last van payment in the amount of {$360.00} ( after 7 years of financing it ) was made on XX/XX/2018 with a balance of {$14.00} left to pay, which I attempted to pay over the phone twice and online twice. ALLY rejected these payments. \\nOn XX/XX/2018 ALLY drafted another van payment in the amount of {$360.00}. \\nI called and emailed them from their website numerous times. After 3 weeks they reimbursed me the amount of {$350.00} and subtracted the amount of {$14.00} from the {$360.00} they drafted from my account on XX/XX/2018. I received the title to my van at the beginning of XX/XX/2018. \\nI checked my bank account on line on XX/XX/XXXX and saw that ALLY took out another automatic ACH in the amount of {$360.00}. I called and emailed them from their website on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative stated that the payments made to them did not show up on their end or on my account.They requested that I fax them my bank statement proving they they took the money out. Friday XX/XX/XXXX I sent them an email from their website and attaching my bank statement and a email to them. On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I went to my bank and they faxed the bank statement which showed tht they drafted {$360.00} from my account. I checked my account with ALLY on line and it does not show that they took the extra van payments out, but my bank statemnet and balance shows they did. The bank told me that since the ACH agreement was between me and ALLY they ha to close it out.Otherwise I can pay the bank XXXX to unauthorize the draft. But, why should I have to do that? Don't these people communicate with each other? Who else have they donre this to?\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"In XX/XX/2018 my Lease expired on the XXXX XXXX which was through XXXX. At this time I rolled it over into a purchase also with XXXX. At the same time I had a XXXX XXXX but didn't know. During my lease with XXXX I was on automatic payments through their website and payment were made in a timely fashion. I wanted to continue that payment arrangement. I tried to do that but for the first few months they couldn't get the system to function properly. Every time I would call to seek resolution I would end up repeating the same story and couldn't get to anyone to effect change nor could I get a ticket on the problem to reference or a case manager to handle the complaint. After months of the non resolution I stopped making payments and told XXXX I wanted to make payments the way I had for years but didn't want to pay by phone or by check that wasn't convenient. I did this in hopes that it would escalate the issue to someone that could effect change and fix the issue. After every contact with XXXX I told them ( the conversation was recorded ) that I would pay the amount due in full the minute I could pay electronically as I had in the past. My thought was if I continued to pay by mail or phone they would never fix the issue considering it had been months with no resolution. Perhaps non payment would get someone's attention. There are over ten recordings of me saying I would pay immediately if the web based product would function just as it had in the past. In XXXX they repossessed the car and send me a demand letter. Once again I said I would pay the amount due but only by their product that the other 99 % of their customers have access to and enjoy. At this point I felt discriminated against because I didn't have access to the same functions as other customers. I later got the NC AG involved and they wrote a letter on my behalf and agreed with me and we are now in a stalemate. Also XXXX falsified a insurance claim on this car while in their possession as it must have had some damage to it as the Insurance company called to follow up on the claim. This is now effecting my ability to purchase a home and want to access all free services before paying an attorney. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\",\n",

I was told that this company only service customers online. I also asked XXXX in the finance department, why my finance charge, interest, and breakdown on my loan is not showing online and I only see the payments made but nothing else. XXXX told me they do not give statements. So I explain to her I need a monthly account breakdown each month showing interest and other charges I am being charged each month in order for me to pay my car note each month and a balance break down in black and white on their website or paper statement, but this is important if they are servicing my loan. They must bill me fairly and show what they are billing me in black and white. Or they will give me no choice but to also contact the State Attorney Office also for assistance.',\n",

The court order was made for XXXX XXXX to refinance the vehicle and I provided the company with information indicating this as well as copy of him indicating this had been done. It was not until this company reported negatively on credit report that I was made aware of this not taking place. I did not receive any notification from the company advising me that the account was delinquent prior to their reporting negatively on my report. I have made several attempts and requests to have the information removed as well as sent in proof of my not being responsible at the time of delinquency in the form of a court order and this company still is reporting incorrect/negative information on my report.

I called the dealer that same day and I was told that they overlooked processing my refund and that they would process that refund immediately. Their accounting office said that they would send a check to GM Financial. That was almost three ago and I am being informed today by GM Financial that they haven't received a check yet from XXXX XXXX XXXX.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'My Santander auto loan should be part of the class action lawsuit. We took action the summer of XXXX through XXXX XXXX courts to put a hold on all transactions and action until a hearing was taken. At that time we were unaware of the lawsuit. Covid hit and we had no hearing set, but found out about the lawsuit. I feel we were overlooked because we put the hold in the court thinking that we were doing the right thing. They say our loan should not be part, but I feel that I have proof of unfair and predatory lending and fit into the subprime practices of the company. The loan originated on XX/XX/XXXX and falls into the actions by us being taken before XX/XX/XXXX. The company violated the fair lending requirements of the ECOA ( Regulation B ). Proof of that should be the 3 copies that I have from the Automobile sales company of them restructuring this subprime auto loan. I have sent a letter to my Attorney Generals office and was directed on XX/XX/XXXX to call Santander, whom I have had no contact with due to the court advising me onto do so. Santander was harassing me with phone calls even after the court order was on file. I have All dates in my phone. It is starting again due to we tried to have a lawyer take this action and he wasnt following through. I called XXXX XXXX who also directed me to Santander. I then called Santander on XX/XX/XXXX spoke to XXXX # XXXX who said that he had nothing saying that my loan was eligible. I asked who could evaluate my loan and he only offered to settle ; even after Santander illegally took the vehicle while the petition was in court. I then called CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX to be sure I should put in this complaint. There is not a loan number on my contract.',\n",

Loan was approved XX/XX/XXXX. Subsequent documents were signed on this day. NUMEROUS calls were made to the initial loan officer from both our business number and cell numbers regarding updates concerning the vehicles titling & registration concerns. \\n\\nLoans were transferred/refinanced to this XXXX, Wyoming Branch from a credit union in the state of Alaska so a new title and registration needed to be issued. As of todays date XX/XX/XXXX we have yet to receive title transfer information on this vehicle. We are currently paying on the loan as of XX/XX/XXXX and the bank has not provided us with new titling documents to update the state in which it should be registered. Tags and plates have not been issued and we have been asked by the local police department to obtain current tags and license plates for the vehicle with Alaska plates. A police officer documented this on XX/XX/XXXX. After receiving the warning on the ticket issued by the officer we again contacted the bank and requested to speak in person to the branch manager. The branch manager assured us the paperwork would be handled in a timely manner and that the loan officer who initiated our loan was no longer with their branch.\\n\\nThe larger of the loans is an additional commercial vehicle thats Wyoming tags were set to expire on XX/XX/XXXX and we voiced our concerns with the loan officer that the loan be processed in a timely manner. Unfortantely as of todays date XX/XX/XXXX the vehicle has been out of service because of expired tags since that date with no update on the titling and registration with the state of Wyoming. We were told the process to update the information with the state of Wyoming would take up to 10 days. It has now reached 45 days. This vehicle is a work vehicle and has now been out of service because of expired tags since XX/XX/XXXX. Commercial Insurance costs have been paid on this vehicle for our business use and we have been unable to operate our company with it.\\n\\nWe have Now been paying on a loan since XX/XX/XXXX thats paperwork was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX on a vehicle that can not be driven because of expired tags and on a vehicle with out of state tags that are now ticket worthy according to the state of Wyoming Police Department. \\nWe have sent emails to this U.S Bank branch that have gone unanswered and have made several calls and left messages that have not been returned.\\n\\nThe only updated response we have gotten has from the branch manager regarding any updates stated ; BRANCH MANAGERS EMAIL sent XX/XX/XXXX ; Attached is the POA that would be required for both vehicles. This is in order to finish processing the titles since technically the business owns the vehicles. I would need two ( 2 ) original copies signed and notarized for both vehicles.\\n\\nThis Power of Attorney was taken to and reviewed by our business attorney. We were told by both the bank and our attorney that is was for the purpose of the bank titling and registering the vehicle for us. \\n\\nOUR RESPONSE ; After waiting over 45 minutes at the local branch and being told the branch manager was expected to arrive and never showed we emailed the following ; We dropped the notarized release form for the titling/registration of the XXXX this morning. Placed them on the seat at your desk. Can you email to confirm that you received rhem. Thanks! \\n\\nBRANCH MANAGERS RESPONSE ; Yes I did get those, thank you! I have them going down to get processed tonight ... It does take our back office up to 10 business days. I will keep my ear to the ground and let you know when everything has been taken care of so you can get the cars registered. \\n\\nWE RESPONDED ; Wasn't the purpose of signing the power of attorney to have you as the bank register the vehicles? Wasnt that the whole point of signing the power of attorney?\\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX The email has gone unanswered.\\n\\nNumerous attempts to resolve this issue including several calls, numerous visits in person and emails that have gone unanswered has resulted in us filing a complaint as we have a right to proper and timely lending practices. The proper paperwork to legalize the use of these vehicles in the state of Wyoming after finalizing a loan on XX/XX/XXXX should be expedited by US Bank and their associates.\",\n",

When I brought this to Wells Fargo attention they had no idea what happened, I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to alert them of the situation. I called them again on the XXXX to discuss the situation further and to see the actions that would be taken to correct the issue. The escalation department followed up with me on XX/XX/XXXX telling me what happened and that situation would be corrected, the second loan would be deleted and that they had received the payoff check from my credit union where I had already refinanced the car on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative also spoke to the loan officer at my credit union advising that every thing was taken care of and the money would be applied and corrected to the first loan and the loan for the car was released to the credit union. On XX/XX/XXXX I discovered that the loan for the car had been paid off with my credit union and Wells Fargo are the ones who paid it off. When I called Wells Fargo they advised that I had not paid off the account and that the loan was still open and active with them and that it needed to be paid. I advised that I had spoken to someone in their escalations department and they advised everything thing they had taken care of. They advised that they were not sure why but the check was reissued. On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by the escalations department again and they advised that they wanted to speak to someone at my credit union and tried her best to advise why the check was sent back and see if the credit union would reissue the check to them. Luckily my credit union was ok with not checking my credit again since it has dropped from the amount of checks it has had recently. Wells Fargo advised they would be issuing a credit correction for me but when I asked on the XXXX I was advised that it also hadn't been completed yet. I was advised on XX/XX/XXXX that the credit correction would be done and still nothing yet.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'In XXXX of XXXX I refinanced my XXXX XXXX XXXX from Bridgecrest to a new lender. I was not aware that time but my GAP insurance was cancelled and I was owed a refund of {$640.00}. At that time Bridgecrest did not advise me of this. For an entire year they withheld the {$640.00} after my loan was no longer with them. Finally in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter indicating that if I would like to receive my GAP insurance refund I had to sign and submit the attached request. I did that and the request was processed by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Last week I contacted XXXX XXXX via e-mail because it appeared that had an old address on the confirmation the sent me. They told me that Bridgecrest would be sending the check and I had to contact them. I have an auditory processing disorder so my wife contacted Bridgecrest for me that same day and the indicated they had no idea what she was talking about and told her to call back the next day to talk to the financial department. \\n\\nShe waited a week to give it time to get in their system, then she called back two days ago. She spent almost 45 minutes on the phone waiting on hold. Eventually the representative told her that they had to contact XXXX XXXX. The rep contacted XXXX XXXX, confirmed that there was a GAP refund of {$640.00} that needed to be sent. The representative came back on the call with my wife and told her that the check won\\'t be sent yet because XXXX XXXX hasn\\'t yet notified them. Even though XXXX XXXX JUST told her that a refund was owed, so I\\'m not sure how almost 4 weeks later that isn\\'t \" notification \\'\\'. The rep told my wife that it could be up to another 4 weeks! \\n\\nMy wife also asked about the issue of the incorrect address. The rep said that she would add a note to the file but couldn\\'t guarantee it would be sent to the correct address. The old address is no longer forwarding my mail so if the check is sent there it will be as good as gone! \\n\\nMy wife asked if the funds could be directly deposited to my bank account and the rep never really answered her question and just brushed her off and talked about the mailing date. \\n\\nIn the current days of massive job layoffs and covid-related expenses, this {$640.00} would go a long way in helping my family. However, after holding on to it for a YEAR after it should have been return, it seems Bridgecrest is in no hurry to send it to me.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I ask that you please give me the chance to provide documentation to verify my statements to follow. This is probably a long shot ... I recently discovered the Reaffirmation Agreement Santander Bank Lawyers & I negotiated prior to my Bankruptcy Discharge in XXXX added an additional 2 yrs. to my Chrysler Capital car loan. My car payments have always been paid on time, even w/challenges encountered to pay {$490.00} mo. payment w/o access prior to discharge. Santander & I clearly discussed following terms : To lower my interest rate from 10.9 % to 7 % & recalculate payment to reflect 7 %. Since new payment of {$390.00} was over {$100.00} less than original loan, I trusted & understood loan was recalculated at 7 %. Instead, Santander created the Agreement w/intent to cause me financial harm & their company gain from my losses. Loan supposed to end XXXX XXXX along w/GAP Insurance. However, the purposeful intent to create this legal document ( Agreement ) & intentionally OMIT the loan extension of an additional 2 yrs., I will be w/o GAP Insurance & literally pay an additional {$9400.00} plus on top of the initial loan cost of over {$26000.00}! I now expect to be in serious financial distress as a result of Santander gaining my trust & never to expected they would cause me such harm for monetary gain for their company. My plan was to retire 6 mo. after my car loan ended in XXXX XXXX. I have worked for the XXXX since XXXX as a XXXX, currently for the XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I am very unsure of my future as a result of their intentional financial abuse. Again, my car payment history is outstanding despite the XXXX Bankruptcy filing. I hope this type of abuse is placed in the Bankruptcy Abuse Protection Act. I know I must sound like an XXXX to have this happen to me. I just don't understand why I am unable to obtain assistance. Yes, we both signed the Reaffirmation Agreement. This document is false yet it was filed in the NJ Bankruptcy Court in XXXX, NJ. Thank you for your time.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"XX/XX/XXXX I was looking to buy a used truck for under {$10000.00} I found on the internet. I knew my credit score was weak because I just did my annual free credit report.i found the truck and wanted to make a deal. I then was told that no finance company would do a contract due to the miles and that I needed to look for a more higher price vehicle to guarantee financing.So I was pointed to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.which had a sticker price marked at {$18000.00} on the window the basic model car I then went ahead and just told them to pre screen me to see if I qualify for a loan on the car, I didn't even test drive the car because I didn't think I would be able to afford it.so while in the office I mentioned to the dealership manager that my sister was a employee at their dealership and he assured me that I would be taken care of.ok while the contract was being drawn up the manager walks in the salesmans office and says by the way I'm throwing in a service contract for your car it's really good and it will help your deal go through because finance company 's like that your protecting your investment I mentioned to him it's a new car doesn't it have a factory warranty? His response was I needed it to assure me the loan and I can remove after 6 months.I honestly felt I can trust him being that I have family working there.So then he comes with my credit report and asks me if I was in jail for like 10 years or something why I did not have any sign of revolving credit or bank account or credit cards? I told him I had a car reposessd in XX/XX/XXXX and that it just depressed me and would never let it happen again so I was just cash on hand.he mentioned that no bank would give me a interest at 3 % which is what I asked for I had a lack of credit history total debt was {$1100.00} how a 13.9 % interest rate on my final contract and i was told only chrysler capital was the only one who could finance me was odd. 6 months go by I remove service contract, and I am devastated when I hear XXXX is stopping production on the XXXX.I saw a msrp in XX/XX/XXXX of {$21000.00} fall to {$13000.00} with factory rebates on the same purchase I just made 6 months prior.I can't refinance car because I owe {$16000.00} on a car that was financed at 13.9 % all my payments of $ XXXXmore the 3/4 going towards interest I know cars lose value but this is like a robbery on paper I wrote dealership various letters with no response.all I ask is a fair deal, I like the car.i paint cars for a living and I did some awesome upgrades to the car I want the dealership to rewrite the deal at a lower interest rate without the service contract so it doesn't inflate the price from when I bought the car with the {$1000.00} down I put on it and I don't think it's fair to be mislead into buying a car because of the price keep in mind I walked in looking for a truck.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Letter to WF dated XX/XX/XXXX : I am writing to finalize and complain about the harassment that I have had with WF in regard to this loan. This will be my last attempt to settle this debt ( inappropriately processed ), related to my XXXX home construction loan that I obtained from WF. I am a victim of misleading and false statements and promises made by your representative during the fiasco of my construction loan. Also, I have attempted to previously discuss this loan with WF. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, at XXXX, I left a voice message with XXXX at XXXX and havent received a return call. It is aggravating to have to present over and over the timeline of what was one of the worst times in my life. \\nIn late XXXX, my husband and I, sought to build our dream home in XXXX, OR. We were approved a home construction loan through the XXXX WF office. We began construction and during the process our general contractor, XXXX XXXX, bailed on the entire project leaving it unfinished and us holding the bag. He was not sufficiently vetted or screened by your Real Estate Construction Loan Department and other construction related insurances that would assure that construction would be completed. In fact, he withdrew funds from the WF escrow construction funds and failed to use these funds to build our home. He filed for bankruptcy and had all debts discharged including our {$67000.00} judgment against him. We were only able to collect {$10000.00} from the performance bond ( XXXX on the dollar ). \\nInstead of admitting that there were errors and mistakes made by WF, we were told that we must use whatever methods and loans available to us to complete the home. Therefore, we accepted three WF loans. We had the construction loan that would allow no more draws : {$23000.00} signature loan, a WF Visa in the amount of {$10000.00} and WF auto loan that financed my XXXX truck at 129 % of its value and the same loan of which this letter refers to. These new loans plus another of my credit card financed the completion of the house. The WF loan officer promised that once the home was completed, we could refinance into permanent financing to pay off the {$23000.00} promissory note, the {$10000.00} Visa and our truck loan. \\nDue to these unlawful actions of WF, I am claimant of the {$140.00} XXXX class action settlement related to the opening of unauthorized accounts. \\nAfter the home was finally complete, WF refused to refinance the mortgage to incorporate the promissory note of {$23000.00}, the Visa of {$10000.00}, and this auto loan. We were forced to apply to modify the real estate portion of the loan. After WF misplaced ( or never received ) the loan modification package three times, I withdrew {$3800.00} from my retirement to retain an attorney to work through this complicated process. However, during this time WF started foreclosure proceedings. Consequently, we put our home up for sale as a short sale and sold it in XX/XX/XXXX, but continued to battle with WF on the outstanding balances from the Visa and promissory note and this auto loan. \\nI am very tired of dealing and cleaning up all the messes that in fact, WF created. I have been given relief through Court action on one loan with WF being forced to excuse this debt. \\nNow that the auto loan is over 10 years old and the result of WF inappropriate practices, I want WF to release the title to my 2005 XXXX XXXX. Do the right thing finally!',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'In XX/XX/XXXX, I opened an auto loan with Zions Bank for the amount of {$25000.00}. On the original promissory note, it stated that my monthly payments would be {$480.00}. I faithfully paid {$480.00} each month with the exception of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. For those two months, I paid {$100.00} for a payment deferment per Zions Bank \\'s policy. \\n\\nThe apparent problem with the loan began in XX/XX/XXXX. For some reason that Zions Bank has yet to explain, I began to receive monthly payment coupons for my loan which stated that I should pay just over {$400.00}, instead of the original promissory note \\'s stated {$480.00}. I naively assumed that Zions Bank knew what they were doing in managing my loan and had perhaps readjusted something with the loan. So, I began to faithfully pay {$410.00} per month. With each successive month \\'s payment coupon, it reflected that I was AHEAD of my payment schedule since I had paid {$410.00} instead of the stated required {$400.00} per month. \\n\\nAfter nearly 36 months of this payment schedule, the last payment coupon I received stated that I only needed to pay around {$100.00} since I was AHEAD from paying a little extra each month. Unfortunately, I ignorantly assumed that Zions Bank was competently managing my loan, and I did not keep the hard copies of my monthly payment coupons. As you may well understand, I was completely blindsided and dumbfounded when this XX/XX/XXXX ( when my loan should have been paid off ), I received a letter from Zions Bank stating that I owed roughly a {$3500.00} balance on my loan immediately or I would be sent to collections! That so-called balance ( Zions claims ) was the equivalent of the past 36 months of paying {$410.00} instead of {$480.00}. I was never notified of any overdue balance or charges during that 36 months, but, as stated earlier, my monthly payment coupons indicated that I was AHEAD of schedule. \\n\\nAfter a couple of weeks of working Zions Bank, trying to get them to send me copies of my monthly payment coupons that explicitly stated that I should pay {$400.00} instead of {$480.00}, Zions has yet to deliver. Instead, they only sent me my payment history ( see attached ). More disturbing is the fact that after talking to someone that represented the Office of the President of Zions Bank and explaining my situation, her best explanation concerning why Zions Bank would have sent me monthly payment coupons requiring {$400.00} instead of the original {$480.00} from the promissory note was simply, \" I \\'m sorry. That must have been a mistake. \\'\\' It certainly was not my mistake, so why am I the XXXXne being penalized? \\n\\nAfter another week of receiving letters and phone calls from Zions Bank demanding that I pay the so-called balance of {$3500.00}, and with no hope in sight of being able to resolve this dilemma ( with Zions Bank accepting no responsibility ), I simply paid the balance by draining my son \\'s savings account. I have felt absolutely used and abused since that day I paid Zions Bank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. \\n\\nI emailed and called the Office of the President for Zions Bank, once again requesting for them to send me copies of the last 12 months of monthly payment coupons so that I could show them what THEY did with managing my loan, hoping that they might acknowledge their obvious mismanagement of my loan and make things right, but they will not accommodated my request.',\n",

If it pays off my loan then I don\\'t owe them, if the sale does not pay the balance I am responsible for it. I agreed to this option, as there were no other options provided to me by the rep. Furthermore the rep. asked me if the co-owner that is also on the auto loan contract agree with the \" Voluntary Surrender \\'\\' I said yes ( rep. never asked to speak to the co-owner ) Rep. also explained that they will be calling me the following weak to arrange to have the car picked up! \\nI called back a couple of hours later to make sure that the automatic payment was stopped since I was giving back the car. The rep. that answered said no it hadn\\'t been canceled but that she would cancel it. I also asked if it was set in their system for my car to be picked up and she said \" yes \\'\\'. \\nXX/XX/XXXX I went to my car to clean in out but, the car was gone! I proceeded to call Credit Acceptance but they were closed however, there was a recording saying \" if your car has been repossessed and you want to make a payment \\'\\' I now realized that this solution was a very bad solution.

Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice of seizure and personal property inventory in the mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that they on behalf of credit acceptance they have repossessed my car and should I want any of my possessions I would have to pay a storage fee starting at {$70.00} a day.Immediately I called Credit Acceptance and spoke to 3 different reps. with one of the reps. saying that the very first rep. should have to about other options such as deferment, selling the car, and refinancing. However, nothing was resolved between this phone call and the 3 different reps. \\nI contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX and filed a complaint ID XXXX. I received a response via the USPS mail approximately 7 days later dated XX/XX/XXXX. The letter states that the Rep. explained what voluntary surrender was and that the tow company Summary of facts 1. Credit Acceptance Representative DID NOT explain what is all involved with \" Voluntary Surrendor \\'\\' A. Show \\'s as a repossession B. Loan goes into default C. Negative impact on credit 2. Rep. DID NOT ask to speak to co-owner of vehicle. Rep. asked me if co-owner agrees with the surrender I said yes However, co-owner does not.\\n\\n3. Rep. said that someone will be calling next weak to arrange to pick up car. Car was towed on XX/XX/2018. There were NO MISSED CALLS on my phone nor does my phone call records reflect any incoming calls. Moreover the letter from Credit Acceptance states that the tow company tried to contact me and this is simply not true.\\n\\n4.

When the new financial institution called they got the payoff on XX/XX/2017 that was good through XX/XX/2017. The check was received by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2017. At the time my ex thought the loan had been completely paid off, since he had  asked for a payoff. When the new financial institution wrote the check to XXXX XXXX, they did not figure in the interest for that gap. I received a call on XX/XX/2017 stating the payment was late and would affect my credit score. A payment of {$300.00} is what was left on the account. I was told it was due on XX/XX/2017. I had previously called in to be sure the loan was in good standing before this, and I was  reassured it was. I have NEVER been late on a payment. When speaking with XXXX XXXX I pleaded with them on what I needed to do for this to not impact my credit score. I was told I would need to have the payment made today, as the reports are not sent until month end. I was told if it was taken care of within that week, I would not see a negative impact. I hung up the phone and called my ex and he made the payment that day. After he called, I called back in to confirm payment was showing in process and paid. I was told on the phone that I did not need to worry about it affecting my credit, that a note would be made on the account and it would be taken care of without a negative impact. They completely lied to me. My credit now shows a late payment when I did exactly what was asked of me and within the same day. I did not stretch it out or let it slide. I wrote XXXX XXXX a letter asking for a one time forgiveness and explained the situation, they would not grant it. The reasons why I was unaware about the loan was I had confirmation from him it had been paid off, which is why I did not realize there was a balance. XXXX XXXX stated that the other financial institution would have to write a letter stating their mess up, even though they know exactly what happened even though the loan was always timely and only with them for a year. I do not even know who the new financial institution is, as I am not on the loan. I would just really appreciate a one time courtesy from them as I was the cosigner and I would've taken care of it sooner had I been made aware. I feel that they waited to be able to penalize me and intentionally drop my credit score. For someone who always pays on time this extremely frustrating.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I refinanced my truck through state employees a few months ago. I was originally financed through Regional Acceptance Corporation ( I believe its a sun trust or truist bank now, was originally a BB and T ). I received phone calls from regional Acceptance about me paying bills after I refinanced my truck. I told them that I was no longer financed with them. My old roommate called me a few weeks ago and told me that a repo company was trying to take my truck and I immediately tried to call or get in touch with them about this. I would call, get put on a long hold, and then I would get hung up on. About last week, I finally got in contact with them and thought I straightened everything out. He said that he was sorry for the inconvenience and said that my truck will no longer be repoed. Just about an hour ago, I received another phone call in regards to my truck. They asked me if I had possession of my vehicle still and I said yes. She said that my truck was up for repo and I need to pay the money that I owe to regional Acceptance or it will get towed. I tried to explain the situation once again and then asked to be transferred to a higher up. She said she would and I heard the phone click as she hung up the phone and the line disconnected. I have received phone calls and then the line would disconnect out of nowhere. Im trying to get my bank to help me fix the issue. I can not have my truck towed for no reason because I work at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and Im in XXXX XXXX. If I lose my truck I will be in a very inconvenient situation. If I can get a phone call whenever yall have a chance, I have evidence that shows that regional signed for the check. I have the email of the gentleman that I sent the proof to from regional and was told it would be taken care of. I also have phone logs showing that the phone call was made and that I attempted to call back. \\n\\n\\nMy number is XXXX Thank you.',\n",

Exeter said the payoff check was sent the wrong address so they did not due the refinance, also with that check was the monthly payment for the car for XXXX Exeter cashed that check. we got the right address and sent another check on XX/XX/XXXX for a payoff without even receiving the first payoff check back.so i was told by one of the Exeter employees that the payoff check an another montly payment checks was received but by the mount of the payoff check being so large it took days to process but they processed the small one for the monthly payment. so a few days later i contacted exeter employees to see if the check was cleared and they said yes and that some how i still owe an XXXX dollar balance the XXXX was paid and i was told that everything was good the refinance was good. One week later i got a phone call from exeter saying that i was late on my monthly payment. I told Exeter that it was not possible that i was late due to the refinance i was not with them anymore and they said they didnt have any of that information about a refinance on file. they also said they received a second check. I really need a answer Asap because im also paying my bank for the refinance for two months now. i cant afford to keep paying exeter extra money.for two months they have took extra money from me',\n",

I called the two ladies on Friday morning at XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX and some man named XXXX or XXXX as he called himself advised that he had reviewed the account and the information would stand as he show it. That is not fair for Santander to go back and place that information in our credit when we have never lost the car we are still driving the car and we have continued to make the payments and we have been current on the payments the last three years. they have also jumped again and made a determination without giving us a chances. This does not need to stay on our credit history for 7 years. We have not declared anything and we have paid for this car.',\n",

I cancelled the payment for the XXXX and made a payment for the XXXX. They took a payment for the XXXX and the XXXX. I tried to get a refund and was told it takes XX/XX/XXXX business days to send the info to another department and they have XX/XX/XXXX business days to send it to another department who has XX/XX/XXXX business days to send me a check. I contacted my Credit Union and made an unauthorized deduction report. The money was back in my account in 2 days. So, I refinanced the loan with my Credit Union and got a 10 day payoff amount. I went on line and made a payment for the balance the day after the refinance money was in my checking account. I waited for the money to be transferred for about 10 business days and nothing happened. I called Ally Financial and was told the payment was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Why would I get a 10 day payoff amount and schedule it for 4 months later? The person on the phone said I needed to change the date and she would walk me through the process. I kept her on speaker and brought up the account online. When I tried to change the date, the calendar would not change. I had to close the online site and reopen it. And after another few attempts I was able to get the calendar to change. I then asked why the payoff amount was more and I was told there was a XXXX dollar a day charge which added to the balance. This is the most difficult financial group I have ever had to deal with. Why would anyone get a 10 day payoff amount and schedule the payment for XXXX? My experience times a few XXXX more means big money for them.',\n",

I turned my XXXX XXXX XXXX in in XXXX of XXXX. The last payment that I had to make was XX/XX/XXXX since I leased a new vehicle at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, it is this payment you have accused me of not paying. I have attempted to rectify this error with documentation from the Financial Institution by way of statements that showed the monies removed from my account. Your refusal to accept that is unacceptable. \\nWith that documentation you have refused to accept it and sent my account to a collection agency. Well today I have the last laugh on you, as you will have seen attached with this letter is a official letter from the financial institution acknowledging the funds were taken from my account and given to your company. \\n\\nHow exactly is a payment that is due on the first of every month, say XX/XX/XXXX, and pay say XX/XX/XXXX delinquent? \\nXX/XX/XXXX To whom it may concern Follow up letter from XXXX XXXX.

If anyone of them took a moment to look over the statements for my XXXX XXXX, and XXXXXXXX XXXX they would have seen that the statements clearly indicate that the monthly payments were due the FIRST OF THE MONTH, NOT the end of the month. Which means my XXXX payment which was due on XX/XX/XXXX, was paid XX/XX/XXXX and the last time I checked XX/XX/XXXX comes before XXXX XXXX. \\nThis means that my XXXX payment was made FOUR DAYS EARLY. Sadly, since your incompetence has caused me damage in the report of a delinquent payment you have forced my hand two follow through with several threats.\\n\\nFirst after having purchased 1 XXXX XXXX, and leasing four additional XXXX Vehicles my family will no longer deal with your unscrupulous company. \\nSecondly, the first letter I sent you, along with the bank document along with this document will be sent to the credit reporting agencies, along with the Attorney Generals office.\\n\\nYour employees incompetence was not my problem till you fraudulently reported a NON-EXISTANT DELINQENT PAYMENT. You should have done your homework. If you had you would have seen your error since my payments were all due on the FIRST of EVERY MONTH, and your company CHOSE THAT DATE.',\n",

I noticed that Global Lending Services reported me 60 days past due for the months of XXXX and XXXX on my XXXX credit file.

I called GLS to inquire why they are reporting me late. The company informed me that because the loan term came to an end, it doesn't matter if I am paying them every month because the full amount is due immediately. The account manager informed me that they will continue to report me late ( even if I pay my monthly payment ) and once the account reached 120 days, the account will be listed as a charge off. The remaining loan amount is also non-consistent. On XXXX the remaining amount displays {$4500.00}. On XXXX the remaining amount is {$6200.00}. On XXXX the remaining amount is {$5800.00}. On The Global Lending Services Site the payoff quote is XXXX. The company is reporting inaccurate information on every platform! This is devastating as I have made sure to continue to pay this company even with the high interest rates and overly high late charges that have accumulated on my account. The account manager informed me that I am still financially obligated, but they will report me late until I give them the full amount ( over {$4000.00} ). This is a predatory loan. I am also accruing a daily interest amount of {$2.00}. This is a trap and really has to be illegal. Please assist me!\",\n",

Not sure what happened to your requests but it should be here tomorrow. This morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX saying, Hi XXXX, If you get the title please send it over today. Once we have it we can go ahead and re-pull the credit to proceed. So Ill take another credit inquiry hit! \\n\\nAttached, please find the documents and personal information they sent me instead of the documents that pertained to my vehicle loan. Theyve disclosed someone elses protected information to me negligently.',\n",

The way the loan was structured I would be paying 200 % of the vehicles value and after multiple failed attempts and no help from the staff or reps at the company I was forced to file for bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I even called to see if there were any payment options due to my situation being XXXX and me not having a steady income and having medical issues, such as my XXXX breaking down or no assistance ( no nurse ) the company still refused to assist me in any way. Lastly I acquired 2 loan companies who were willing to refinance and take over the loan near a 3 % APR and Santander still refused. The companies offering the new rate were upfront with me and wondered how did I even get the loan because I had no drivers license. The gentlemen suggested I need to look into it and advised me I may have been targeted just to access may income. After great assistance from the law firm that assisted in filing my chapter XXXX bankruptcy due to Santanders ' unfair practices I am picking up the pieces of my financial ruin. Im not completely blaming them however because of their greed and very confusing XXXX financing terms I was put in a position to fold ( for lack of a better word ).

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I originally took out an auto loan with Navy Federal for a XXXX XXXX XXXX, they took over the tile from the original lienholder, XXXX and Navy refinanced my loan. Approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I was in an accident with the vehicle and it was totalled. My insurance company, XXXX, paid to Navy Federal 70 % of what the vehicle was worth. The remainder balance was reduced through GAP insurance which I had with Navy. The remaining amount of the loan was approximately {$3000.00}. I took out another loan to get a new car because I have to work. I am making a payment of {$570.00} as a monthly car note, my insurance also went up exponentially because my insurance increased my premium due to the accident and because I moved. I applied to refinance the remaining {$3000.00} with Navy and they denied refinancing my loan. They put my loan in default and a delinquent status, which will impair my credit because they denied refinancing my loan and require me to make the regular payment of {$570.00} as I did prior to totalling my car. This put me in a position to make two full car payments with over {$1000.00} per month going out of my paycheck to car loan payments. I can not afford that. I also rent, furniture bill, electric bills and other bills and I can not afford to pay {$1000.00} to car payments. I informed Navy Federal of this and they still denied refinancing my car loan to get my car payments cheaper. I think this it is unscrupulous and unethical for Navy to put me in a position in which I am unable to make the payments and unreasonably denying my refinancing of the remainder of my previous car loan. This puts me in a position to get bad credit through no fault of my own. I am not unwilling to make the payment, I just can't afford {$570.00} per month and I have informed Navy of this fact. Navy is being unreasonable in denying refinancing of my loan.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I\\'m trying to refinance the new auto loan I had through Ally Financial, Inc. with a new lender. Ally reportedly received my check for the payoff on XX/XX/2018. Payments to Ally by mail take 3-5 business days to process, but on the 6th business day it had not posted, which made my account go 30 days past due, which was immediately reported to the credit bureau. Next, on XX/XX/XXXX Ally informed me that the payoff amount was short because ( due to them delaying it ) I owed {$300.00} more in finance charges than the loan is for, and they wouldn\\'t process the check until I made a payment of {$300.00} to cover that gap. I made that payment electronically the same day, and it is the now XX/XX/XXXX. The payoff has still not posted ; I\\'m chatting with their customer service as I\\'m writing this complaint, and Ally is saying they \" may \\'\\' have rejected the check and mailed it back to me ( I\\'ve been waiting for over an hour while they try to find out for sure ). If they really have mailed the check back to me, my new lender would have to cancel their loan and I would have to reapply if I still want to refinance -- but because I now have that 30 day late payment on my credit report ( which would\\'ve been avoided had they processed the check during the time frame they said they would ), my credit has likely been so adversely impacted that I can no longer get the same interest rate I was promised before. Even if the check HASN\\'T been mailed and they DO end up processing it, this late payment will likely hurt my chances of being approved for a home loan now, like I am planning to do soon. It seems as though Ally keeps intentionally delaying the payoff so they can make a last-ditch effort to keep charging me as much interest as they can before I refinance, which I feel may even be illegal.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'In XXXX of XXXX I financed a car loan through XXXX XXXX  - a division of Santander Consumer USA , Inc. The monthly payment was {$500.00} with the first payment due on XX/XX/XXXX, the term of the loan was 72 months in length and I would make my final payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Over the term of my financing I ran into multiple difficulties in making my monthly installment. I was offered a deferment of the payment ( s ) that I was behind. Over the term of my loan, I deferred a total of XXXX payments. Each time I spoke with a representative of Santander they would advise me that my maturity date would be extended and I would be charged a fee of {$25.00} to defer my payment ( s ) and it would bring my account back to good standing. I would be recorded accepting the payment deferment, it would be reviewed and within a week my account would reflect current. I would not sign any paperwork for the maturity date extension. After my final deferment, my new maturity date was now XX/XX/XXXX. As I approached by maturity date I noticed that I still had an unpaid balance of {$6000.00} and knew it would not payoff by XXXX. I called and spoke with several representative at which point they referred me to their Office of the President for resolution. I tried to understand that if my maturity date for each deferred payment was extended how could I still owe so much? I was told that after any payment deferment my loan would turn into a \" Daily Simple Interest \\'\\' loan if I fell delinquent again. I was never told that or did I sign any paperwork with that understanding. Because I needed my car to go to work, their OOP offered me a loan modification for the remaining balance. The balance I owed was then a new term and maturity to payoff my loan. I continued to try and understand how it was possible for Santander to extend my maturity date and turn my loan into a XXXX loan without my knowledge. I am currently still paying a monthly payment to Santander to payoff this balance. On two occasions I have asked a representative to please provide me a copy of my original loan note so that I can review to see if there is verbiage stating that if I accepted a payment deferment, my loan would be subject to XXXX terms. On both occasions, I received only page 1 of my 3 page note. I would like someone to provide me with how and where I was told about the XXXX factor in their payment deferral process. I felt so much appreciation when Santander offered me help through some very difficult financial times during my loan, but never expected that the additional 8 months of loan payments I made through their deferment program would still have me owing {$6000.00}. I am looking for confirmation that Santander \\'s practice is ethical and within Fed Reg guidelines. I want to ensure that others in my same situation do not accept consumer assistance programs from Santander when the consumer is unaware of the consequences of these programs.',\n",

I didnt have established credit and the lender that I got through XXXX XXXX was Santander Consumer. \\n\\nDuring the first part of XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to XXXX XXXX ( still at XXXX XXXX ) to inquire about trading my car for something larger, as I have a wife, XXXX children and a nephew that I am the father figure for, to provide transportation for daily. XXXX stated that he would look into the inventory and trades at XXXX XXXX and get back with me. \\n\\nBetween approximately XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I stopped into XXXX XXXX to ask if there was an update about any vehicles. XXXX told me there was a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( with a sunroof ) that was being repaired and he would get a hold of the body shop doing the work, so that I could go see it. From what XXXX said, the price, body style, and condition of the XXXX sounded great. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received the address of the body shop that had the XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX. I took my mother out with me to see it, but there was no XXXX to be found. We went back to XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX, who again assured my mother and I what a great vehicle this was. ** My mother is XXXX, and my father had a XXXX XXXX  at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX because of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I needed to have a solid vehicle with room for all of my family or all the things my parents would have to take on many trips back to XXXX. ** On XX/XX/XXXX, I texted XXXX XXXX to start working up what XXXX XXXX would give me for a trade. He stated that he would have the paperwork at the dealership for me to pick up on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI arrived at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was promised the XXXX would be there on XX/XX/XXXX I just needed to get my financing and {$1000.00} cash or check for them to hold. I had my mother with me again, and she refused to let them keep {$1000.00} cash. I went to my bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and dealt with Assistant Vice President, XXXX XXXX. She reviewed XXXX XXXX paperwork and found that they had over charged me several XXXX dollars. \\n\\nI texted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX AM that there were paperwork errors from XXXX XXXX that needed to be fixed. I went to XXXX XXXX they agreed there was a mistake and corrected the paperwork. I went back to my bank and received a loan and a {$1000.00} check to hold the XXXX. I took a copy of the unsigned loan and a {$1000.00} check back to XXXX XXXX and completed paperwork for the purchase of the XXXX XXXX XXXX pending I liked the vehicle upon being able to physically examine/drive it. \\n\\nThe XXXX  was not ready to see on XX/XX/XXXX. I had stopped in to see XXXX and he explained that the sunroof was taking a bit of time, it was a new shop for the dealership, ect and promised I could see it on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I took my mother down to see the XXXX at XXXX XXXX. My mother and I were very disappointed. There was no sunroof, there was extensive hail damage to the body, after being detailed there were really bad stains and my mother got excited when she lifted the floor mats and there was mold/water damage. XXXX explained he didnt know how this happened. My mother went into the dealership and demanded the {$1000.00} check back. At this point, we were separated.XXXX kept telling me what deals he could make me, that were way out of my price range, not to let my mother boss me, ect. Several salesman and financial people were inside and refusing to give my mother back the {$1000.00} check without her looking at other vehicles, buying a vehicle herself, having me buy a different vehicle, ect. My mother explained very colorfully that she lent me the money for the check ( that is true ) and she wanted that check now. She got the check. I took my mother back to the bank and had to have Assistant Vice President, XXXX XXXX, destroy the loan for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nApproximately XXXX XXXX, I went to look at trading my car at another dealership. I had my mother with me. As we sat with the financial people at the dealership, it was discovered that XXXX XXXX paid off my auto loan with Santander on my XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX! My note to Santander was paid off by XXXX XXXX and the title of my XXXX was now titled to XXXX XXXX! XXXX XXXX OWNED my car that I was making car payments and insurance payments on. \\n\\nI took my mother down to XXXX XXXX. We spoke with XXXX XXXX who found everything funny and told me the only way out now, was to buy a car from XXXX XXXX. My mother was not amused and demanded to see someone to answer some questions. An elderly lady with blonde hair and wearing tacky leopard everywhere, came to see us. She explained that it was a small back office error, I could always buy a car at XXXX and it would be a seamless transition. My mother stated that was not acceptable. The elderly lady stated that since XXXX XXXX owned my car, that they could also re-possess it at any point and my mother may want to watch her tone. My mother stated she wanted to see the XXXX XXXX dealership owner, XXXX XXXX - her request was refused. \\n\\nSince that time, I have stopped into XXXX XXXX several times to speak with XXXX. I am told I can buy a car from them and save myself the headache of dealing with Santander. It is also always a joke about my XXXX XXXX not being repossessedyet! I feel that as a threat to buy from XXXX XXXX or else. \\n\\nI have sent 3 signed and notarized XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  forms to Santander to get the title in my name. On XX/XX/XXXX, Santander claimed to have the XXXX I sent, but, XXXX XXXX would not do their part whatever their part is. On XX/XX/XXXX, Santander called me to inform me that I never sent in a XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Santander and demanded that someone give me a live person and fax number that I could fax a XXXX. Later that day, I faxed a XXXX to XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Santander to see if the fax was received no one knew. \\n\\nI am at a loss of what to do. I am paying on and insuring a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX name and have been doing it for 6 months now. I refuse to be strong armed into buying from XXXX to escape the title issue. I am unable to transport my family all together at one time. My father is now XXXX from the transplant. My sister and I each work XXXX hours a week to help support the family. And..the car is ruining my life! \\nIf unable to attach the information, I have documentation to back up everything I am telling you, except for the in-person conversations with the elderly woman and XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'In XX/XX/2013 we purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, financing through Ally Financial. We signed a contract for 72 months. Little did we know, the vehicle had major manufacture defects. At approximatly 120,000 miles we started to notice excessive oil consumption. We began monitoring our oil level daily and took it to a mechanic who then advised us that XXXX had used cheap piston rings in the 2.4L engines and that our piston rings had gone bad and that the oil consumption would get worse. As the oil consumption got worse we took it to yet another mechanic who said the same thing and advised us the only option was to replace the engine because of major scarring and damage inside the engine. We are a family with one income and a XXXX  who is XXXX and has XXXX twice a week, we did not have the money to replace the engine. After speaking to several XXXX dealerships we found that there was a memo from XXXX about the problems but it was not a recall and only covered up to a certain amount of miles, at this point our only option would be to continue to monitor the oil level as XXXX was not offering a solution. By 150,000 the oil consumption had gotten worse, consuming about 2 quarts of oil a week. The vehicle became less reliable, started to loss engine compression, and became harder and harder to start. We contacted Ally to find out why they had changed the terms of our loan, only for them to claim finance charges. We asked if they could rewrite our loan and explained to them the problems we where having with the vehicle and asked to maybe lower our payments so that we could save some money and have the vehicle fixed. They where not willing to help. At this point we had no choice but to find a more reliable vehicle so that our XXXX did not have to miss XXXX or XXXX visits. At this point we have been left with no other options and no where to turn. Ally repossessed the vehicle after 61 days of non payment and will not give us any information as to their intensions, they are going to end up forcing us into bankruptcy because of the changes in the terms of our loan and their unwillingness to rewrite our loan. With the fact that Ally is unwilling to help us and XXXX will not take responsibility for their defect, we feel that we have been wronged by both and have been left with having to make a decision that will affect our family badly, but at this point we have no choice.',\n",

He also mentioned that if I had a job he could get me a lower interest rate? Isn\\'t that discrimination in lending? Why should I be treated any different than anyone else?

XXXX approved my loan refinance and sent a check for the remaining amount to Ally Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nSometime between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Ally Bank denied my refinance and neglected to inform me or my Credit Union about the denial. When pressed for to provide reasons for the denial, I spent several hours ( approximately XXXX hours ) being transferred and hung up on, only to learn that it was denied because the address they ( Ally ) provided ( online ) was incorrect and out of date. They provided me with their \" new \\'\\' address, and I had the Credit Union reissue the check on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nTo avoid having my loan be sent to collections ( with Ally ) while I waited for the new check from my Credit Union to be received, I was told that it would be in my best interest to pay them now, and wait for reimbursement when the check arrived. I was then informed that I would not only need to pay for the month of XXXX, but that I would also need to pay for a previous month, that was now delinquent. When I pressed them to explain why I would need to pay twice within the same month, they told me that it was for the month of XXXX ( XXXX ). I explained to them that would\\'ve occurred before I had even had the car/received the loan, and they then proceeded to lie to me and tell me that it was for \" some \\'\\' month that occurred between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I explained to them that I could demonstrably prove to them that I have made every payment ( on time ) by providing them with bank statements, to which they denied and then sent me to their phone billing system. \\n\\nDuring that experience, I explained to them that I had already tried to make a payment over their ( Ally ) app and over the phone, but I was told that my account was \" not authorized to receive payments \\'\\' multiple times. Despite that, on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) I attempted to make the payment over the phone again ( as I was told that the issue involving my account had been corrected ), only to learn that they had still not corrected the issue, citing that my account had been suspected of fraud. I was then directed to make a payment over \" XXXX \\'\\', which I did, paying an additional ~ {$30.00} to guarantee that my account would not be sent to collections on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nTo top it all off, I learned on XX/XX/XXXX, that the subsequent address that they provided me when my Credit Union sent them the second check was also wrong/outdated, and I would need to put a stop payment on that one as well. I called my Credit Union to do so, and they said they would be unable to stop a cashiers check until the check was denied, or 15 days pass. I\\'ll be a waiting a full month and a half - assuming nothing else is messed up - to finally transition my loan to my existing Credit Union ( from Ally Bank ).\\n\\nI have been lied to, I have been called a liar, I\\'ve been told that I am mistaken. My credit is on the line - and no one I talk to can provide me with a consistent narrative as to why this is happening to me.',\n",

At that point I called USAA and let them know there was still a balance on my XXXX loan and it appeared the payoff was never received by them from USAA. I was told at that time that they would reissue the check and take care of the issue prior to my payment due date on XX/XX/XXXX since I had already made my XXXX payment to USAA for the new loan obtained. \\nUnfortunately that is not what happened. Instead on XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a copy of the check that was supposedly cashed by XXXX. This check had no endorsement information on the front or back of the check that was discernible. \\nI opened a case with XXXX, provided them all of the check information and a copy of the check. They have been unable to locate it on their system. I have called both USAA and XXXX multiple times every week to try and resolve this issue, which is still unresolved. \\nUSAA finally provided me with a XXXX tracking number last week for the check.

XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a representative from Exeter Finance stating when I'm ready to refinance my vehicle that I can do so with them. I was guaranteed on three separate occasions that I'll be able to refinance my vehicle. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was trying to refinance my vehicle, I spoke with a representative and I was told that I'm not able to refinance my car. I called back again just to verified that I heard correctly, I was told that Exeter Finance DOES NOT refinance vehicles. At this point, I realized that I was fooled by the dealership and by Exeter Finance, I asked this question several times. From this point on, I researched several different financial institutions and all of them denied me of refinancing my vehicle, I've never missed a payment and now I stuck paying a 26 % interest rate that I still owe {$6500.00}. Exeter Finance was very dishonest and they refused to decrease my interest rate despite that I haven't missed not one payment and I was told several times in XX/XX/XXXX, that I'll be able to refinance my vehicle.\",\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced this loan with Bank of America. Made all Payments on time.In early XX/XX/XXXX, My car was stolen and then recovered. It was a total loss, I continued making payments though out this process. The payoff check from the insurance was processed XXXX XXXX. Which left a balance of XXXX on the acc. \\nAfter this I heard nothing from BOA and could access the current Balance on my Online mobile banking. So XXXX \\'s Payment went though, XXXX \\'s payment went though, and XXXX \\'s payment went through. My Payment Date for this loan is XXXX of each month. So then on XXXX XXXX I get a notification that a Charge off was placed on my Credit files with all Three Bureaus from BOA. Stating that {$210.00} was charged off??? and isn\\'t due till XXXX XXXX which would be my last payment. This is crazy I Made all Payments. \\nI Spoke with XXXX XXXX and she was not helpful, and for a week I got no repose. Then they fabricated a whole Story about how i was suppose to Pay off that Balance of {$850.00} with in 60days, then they said i had no GAP which I do.. when I said had \" no notice \\'\\' of this arbitrary 60 policy, she stated they wouldn\\'t remove it. Even though they were auto-debting the acc every month. Bank Of america is blatantly trying to save face and not fixing this false Charge off. I am inclosing a full payment history which shows on time payments. I had to get a print out from the a bank Employee because they where told not to give to it to me, But Lucky there own employee saw how wrong they where treating me and printed it off for me anyway.The cover up of this false Charge OFF is sicking!! ACC of this loan as it was deleted off my online Banking for this reason. But i have the evidence. My Previous Credit Score Was XXXX This Damaged my Score over 75 points. All of this for no reason!! And they refuse to fix it. \\nAnd also the XXXX XXXX Lady had the audacity to try and collect the {$210.00} that never should of been charged off in the first and still not fix the charge off on my credit!!!! I will Pursue legal Action If this isn\\'t fixed. And to think all these idiots had to do was wait till the auto-debt on the XXXX of XXXX the payment would be done!!! even on the credit report the BOA states Charge Off Never Late How smart is that? Again This XXXX lady couldn\\'t answer why the charge off was placed on my acc even though they still where getting payment.',\n",

His vehicle was finally repossessed on XX/XX/2021. \\nMy half sister had a STRONG interest in keeping the truck and trying to catch up previous missing payments. I have been trying to talk her out but she insists. \\nI have been labeled on his account through Ally Finance themselves as the \" informant \" on the account. Also my name is the one listed on my father \\'s death certificate. I also repeatedly told Ally on their recorded line \" please do not discuss any account information with anyone other than myself in order to perfect the privacy of the deceased \" they obliged. \\n\\nMy sister is pretty persistent so she kept calling trying to get payoff balance. And on XX/XX/2021 she calls me on 3 way with Ally Auto finance. They proceeded to give her the sensitive account information and I couldn\\'t stop it. They did not speak or get any verification info from me. And she was able to have the representative give her the account info with only the account number. They told her status of account as well as the charge off date. The only reason i didn\\'t cut them off was ti avoid personal conflict with my sister and other family members. \\n\\nThe reason I am filing this complaint is Ally Financial did not respect my wishes of non disclosure to persons other than myself. They also violated the law by talking this account info without going through proper verification. \\nThere was a reason I wanted this to stay discrete and now it\\'s causing distress among my and family members. Serious potentially dangerous distress. I am looking for all possible options at this point. \\nAcct name is under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and time of call was XX/XX/2021 around XXXXXXXX XXXX cst. Call took place on their recorded line. \\nMy name is XXXX XXXX the son and only informant authorized to discuss account info.',\n",

( I worked over seas at the time, so i was unable to retrieve any mail ). She did advise me of fees that were at the end of my loan that i would need to take care of ( late fees etc ). I asked her could i possibly make smaller payments towards those ( fees ) at a later time possibly XXXX $ per month and she said sure. At this time, Im am under the impression that my car principle balance is paid off, the title is in the mail and this car after 5 years is mine. I was aware of ( fees ) that i owe to this company for late payments and etc. but she told me the car principal balance was paid. On XX/XX/XXXX, my car was repossessed by this same company. I never received 1 call from them or letter but they picked my car up from my address. I was never made aware that my car was in any default status. I kept the same number for a year and it was discovered that during the course of that time i was not called. Im not sure if the representative intentionally gave me False or misleading information, however her negligence has cost me my vehicle and my financial reputation. I have been in contact with the company since the repossession and i have filed a complaint in this representative for her misrepresentation of my account. As a consumer, i feel as though my account was mishandled, i would have made a more educated decision if i was aware of the potential consequences of my account. In the year that this business took not reaching out and making me aware of my debt it caused detrimental damage. I pull my credit report regularly and this account stated closed as well as a zero balance online. This company should be held accountable for misleading consumers or not making sure their customers understand closing details and charge off statements.',\n",

I called to ask why there was still a $ XXXX balance and they said I still owed that amount. They would see if they could do a re-modification of the loan. They came back with an additional 2 years at {$700.00} per month. I have been paying {$700.00} per month for 7 years and can't believe I now owe this much more. This doesn't seem reasonable to pay another $ XXXX for a car that will be 9 years old and the book value right now is < XXXX. I asked them to send me the agreement and the APR is 21 %. The breakdown is still part to the principle and part to the interest. I have not signed the agreement. I am considering voluntary repossession but I know this will severely affect my credit. ugh! They are bilking people with low credit scores. I suggested that I could sell the car to XXXX for XXXX if they would accept that as a payoff and they refused and told me to trade it in towards another car. I am almost XXXX years old and don't want another car payment. Please help!\",\n",

I went on XXXX XXXX   website to see if I could get the required information and did find a way to get a pay out amount and what date it was good to and I emailed that to the new lending institution but he said that info was not sufficient for his requirements and did in fact need the Lease Buyout Packet originally requested.\\n\\nI again called Honda Financial on XX/XX/2020 and again spent an inordinate amount of time >1 hour  waiting for a live pickup. This time I requested the support person 's name, XXXX, and explained to her what transpired the previous day and asked why the requested information was never sent. She had all of the right information, new lending agent 's name and fax number from yesterday 's call. I asked her how much time should be expected to get a simple fax out and she agreed it shouldn't be too long. I'm assuming it's an automated process. She said she would resend, I gave her the new lender 's direct phone number so she could validate it was received. She placed me on hold and attempted to call the new lender but did not receive validation. I subsequently emailed the new lender and awaiting feedback.\",\n",

I was like \" wait a minute that doesn\\'t sound right, I Just paid you. \\'\\' He couldn\\'t give me a straight answer of when it was and where I was behind. I have called to several times to get straight answers on all stemming from this one incident. I have been told 2 out of 3 times that they do not do automatic payment plans to someone else saying yes they do automatic payment plans. They have never informed me that they do online automatic payments through online banking. I have asked to speak to management only to be yelled at. This has been THE MOST unprofessional company I have ever had the displeasure to come across. All representatives have been inconsistent with company policy. I have been asking for over 30 days for a 10 day pay off letter which I am entitled to obtain, I am looking to refinance through another bank with a higher interest rate just so I do not have to do business with Wells Fargo. I have utilized my resources to obtain further assistance, Consumer Affairs counselor from XXXX XXXX XXXX was able to contact Well Fargo and spoke with XXXX supervisor of customer service. XXXX stated that she will email XXXX with the 14 day pay off and the payment history for the length of the loan for review. I would like to resolve this matter by receiving the 14 day pay off letter and for the lender to adjust my credit report history within the Fair Credit Reporting Act.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Due to a family fall out, I am currently having to refinance my vehicle to get my father off of loan that he is a cobuyer on. I was told by the bank that is willing to refinance my vehicle for me that I needed to request a payoff from my current lender. Not an issue. I called them on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a rep who told me the only way I was able to get my payoff was to go into a local branch or make an online account and get it from there. I live in Arizona and originally got the loan financed through a bank in Georgia. So the closest actual branch to me was in Texas, I told the gentleman that. He said if that was the case that I would just have to make an online account and would be able to receive my payoff from there. Yes, I did mention to him that I needed it for refinancing purposes. Due to not having an email on file, he told me because my email needed to updated that it would take 2 business days to get my account set up. Due to needing to email me a confirmation that says my account is ready to be set up. He said to wait for an email and that's what I did and never received one. So I followed up yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX and they told me that the account was never set up. I was then on the phone with a representative for 32 minutes just trying to get my account set up - not that representatives fault, she was very helpful and informative. My sole complaint is about the gentleman that helped me on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX. I told him that I have never heard of it being so difficult to get a payoff for a loan, did not even offer to mail it to me. Nothing. It was frustrating because I work for a finance company myself and I know there are many ways to receive a payoff then what I had been told by him. I did not mention that I needed a payoff to the individuals that I spoke with on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, because I was just anxious to get online to get my payoff - like the rep from Thursday had told me. Once I finally got help with setting it up on Monday, I quickly logged on just to have a message online tell me that I needed to contact them if I wanted a written payoff. At that point I was absolutely upset. It's already stressful the situation I am having to deal with, let alone not even being provided the correct information prior to get this done the right way. I was also at work while trying to do this and having to go back and forth to get a hold of someone but the wait was constantly 50 minutes or more and when they called back, I was always on the phone at my own job with a customer to where I couldn't answer. I called later Monday night, still XX/XX/XXXX and at that point they told me the loan servicing department was  closed, which I thought that's who I had been dealing with the whole time, but at this point it just sounded like customer service. That rep provided me the number and business hours to call and speak with someone in regards to getting a payoff. I called this morning, Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, and the representative I had spoke with informed me that the easiest and quickest way for me to get a payoff since I am refinancing is to have the other lender fax in a document request with my name and loan account number. She said the soonest they would have it is 24-48 hours. At that point I finally got the answer I needed, but why didn't the representative that I spoke with on Thursday inform me of this? To save the time, the hassle and the absolute headache. I would have never had to make an account, I would have never had to wait on hold for 32 minutes to make my account and I am just really mad and upset that I was relayed the wrong information in the first place because I could have had the payoff to me by now, if not within the next 24 hours - I could have had the current lender that I am working with request it that same day on Thursday if I was told the correct information. I can not wait to be done with this company and really hope that a training opportunity is taken upon that rep so no one has to go through what I went through. Like I said, I work for a finance company, so I know how big of a deal this complaint can be and that's why I am making it known because it really did frustrate me and make it a struggle to get something so simple.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I purchased a 2009 XXXX XXXX about two years ago. I financed the vehicle with US Auto Credit Corp. I recently began to have mechanical issues with the vehicle. The repair costs made it difficult for me to afford my bi-weekly payments. I reached out to US Auto Credit to inform them of the situation and to find out if there were any options available to help me reduce the financial strain to avoid late payments or defaulting on the loan. The only option presented to me was a forbearance. The forbearance wasnt a good option because it would have extended my loan term. The maintenance is going to be required more frequently in the future. The forbearance only provides temporary relief. At this point Ive made over 50 bi-weekly which totals close to {$10000.00}. The interest rate is 26 %. It would be close to impossible for me to pay the car off before it died. Since US Auto Credit didnt have any other options I had to look into refinance options. Luckily my bank approved the refinance but they would only approve {$6600.00} which is the value of the vehicle. I was told the payoff amount was around {$7700.00}. I would have to pay the difference. I didnt have {$1100.00} but I really needed to do this refinance. It lowered my interest rate, payment, and term by almost 50 %. I went back to US Auto to ask if they would write off a portion or reduce my balance. They sent me a settlement offer for {$7100.00}. The loan wouldnt be reported as paid in full but as paid in full- charge off less than balance. They also said that the would issue a XXXX for the any reduction amount greater than {$600.00}. I finally spoke with a supervisor XXXX XXXX who said there wasnt much more they could do. He advised me to continue paying on the car for another year ( {$4400.00} ) and try to refinance at the end of the year. At the end of our conversation he told me that he would have upper management look at it but he was almost positive that they didnt have any other options available. He said hes never seen them offer any other options for situations like mine in the 4 years of his employment. The companys mission statement says the want to help and treat consumers with fairness and dignity. My experience has been the complete opposite. I feel like this company is taking advantage of people with less than perfect credit. I dont feel like the lending practices are designed for you to successfully pay off a loan. And when you get into a situation like mine which I feel was created by their predatory lending practices ... they dont offer viable options to help. They relentlessly demand money and refuse to offer fair resolutions ... leaving you stuck or putting a person into a worse credit situation. I was young with poor credit and I needed a car. This company took complete advantage of that. The dealer made it seem like this company would be doing me a big favor by approving my loan because my credit score was low but I was actually being lied to and taken advantage of. I can only imagine how many people have gone through this and didnt know what to do.',\n",

When the 6 month mark came we tried to refinance the loan but were then told they we would not be able to refinance. We were told by the dealership specifically that they don\\'t help with refinancing, stating that \" refinances don\\'t make them any money. \\'\\' This was despite them telling us we would be able to refinance after 6 month \\'s. We then spoke with Capital One and they told us that they do not take their own refinance loans and we would not be able to refinance with them on our own, even though we were told we could do this by our dealership. We then had further discussion with the dealership and he stated he would help us but every bank he spoke with stated we would have to put more money down to refinance a loan. From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I tried to reach out to the dealership and spoke with them again on the XXXX of XXXX. From there we tried to see if I could get a refinance by myself without XXXX. They then asked for my paystubs and I sent those and waited for him to get back to me. On XX/XX/XXXX I messaged them again because I had not heard anything about my attempt to personally refinance. In my message I asked that while he was looking for a loan that he could find a loan that doesn\\'t have simple interest rates or high interest rates at all. He finally responded and stated we would speak the next morning on the XXXX. On the XXXX I then called and was unable to reach him and left a message. I never heard back from him until the XXXX of XXXX. XXXX stated that there was a bank holiday on the XXXX and asked me to reach out to him the following day. I reached out to him again on the XXXX and he stated he would call me some time in the afternoon. I then told him that was unfair because he stated he would call me first thing in the morning. He then stated he only would have five minutes to speak with me, he let me know that Capital One nor any other bank was able to approve my refinance by myself. During the initial purchase of the car we had already put down XXXX as a down payment but somehow that money can\\'t go towards a refinance. They are continually asking us to put down more money to refinance with no explanation as to why. So far within the loan \\'s life we have already payed XXXX and we still owe approx. XXXX. Nothing we have payed has gone to the principal of the loan and it all has gone towards the interest. No one is willing to work with us on this including Capital One.',\n",

Mailed it signature confirmation, but never signed for. I contacted Bridgecrest, told that was not the best/correct address for payoffs, was advised to cancel check, have new check sent to XXXX, AZ address. Did this on XXXX and new check arrived to me XX/XX/XXXX. In the meantime, received notice from Bridgecrest that loan was paid in full. Assumed they were able to process check before it was canceled. Received call on XXXX, check was returned unpaid. XXXX advised check not paid because it did cancel before they processed it, advised to send second check that I received XX/XX/XXXX. Sent that check XXXX  overnight, signature confirmation. This was signed for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. Received call XX/XX/XXXX, payment late, they haven't received/processed check, a FULL month after check signed for! Received emails about late payment, repossession. I was assured that it was being taken care of, that my account was on a hold status so that nothing would be reported to the credit bureaus. On XX/XX/XXXX, Bridgecrest responded to my XXXX  complaint that my account was paid in full, everything back dated and closed. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another email saying my account was past due and that was the last day I could pay without being reported. I again reached out to my POC, XXXX, who didn't contact me back until XXXX and told me that the second check was returned Insufficient Funds! I knew this was a complete lie. I went to the credit union first thing the next morning where I was able to get a photo of the processed/paid check and the electronic transaction record. I sent her this proof and the next time I tried to log in to the Bridgecrest portal, it said I no longer had an account. I was fine with that, thinking this mess was finally over until I got notification that my account was reported as 60 days past due to the credit bureaus!!! This company is completely incompetent and extremely deceitful. I have tried contacting them multiple times to get them to clear this up with the credit bureaus and I have disputed the reporting myself, but the damage is done! My credit score has dropped over 100 points!! They need to be held responsible for everything that they did, or really everything that they DIDN'T do!\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'My wife and I traded in two vehicles at lease termination and leased a new XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, FL. Incredibly, the salesperson neglected to pay off either of the two vehicles. Hyundai Motor Finance, the lender, started making robo calls about the payment was late. When we called, we were assured the payments were up to date. We discovered the problem when a payoff letter was sent that had late fees on the XXXX XXXX and two payments remaining. The dealership admitted their error and finally corrected the credit reporting issue on that vehicle. \\nThe second vehicle, a Hyundai XXXX, was paid off in XX/XX/2020. Then, the account was found to have late fees of {$190.00}. Hyundai Motor Finance reported us 30 and then 60 days late on a PAID OFF loan. I paid the late fees when notified in XX/XX/2020 ; however, at that point the dealership should have taken responsibility for not including all fees in the payoff and not passed that charge on to the customer. \\nThis is for a customer who has a nine year history with the dealership and finance company. Now, 18 months after the fact, we are refinancing and the two late payments are affecting our ability to get a low interest rate. Repeated attempts to get the dealership to provide a letter stating the facts and how the error was their fault have gone unanswered. I have the original documentation to prove this but the credit bureaus want the creditor to verify the account history.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Hello, I had my car refinanced through XX/XX/XXXXback in late XXXX. In early XXXX, a payoff check was sent by XXXX and XXXX ( new lender ) to Bridgecrest to payoff my loan. Bridgecrest received the check on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX and XXXX noted they had the wrong amount sent on XX/XX/XXXX, so they reissued a new check with the correct amount and put a stop payment on the 1st check. Bridgecrest received the 2nd check and proceeded to sit on the check until XX/XX/XXXX when they finally attempted to cash it over a month after receipt. XXXX and XXXX sent a 3rd check that was received on XXXX XXXX by Bridgecrest. That to this day, Bridgecrest has failed to apply to my account. During this time, I was not notified that the checks weren\\'t cashed. As I received an update on my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX. That stated my Bridgecrest account had been closed. However, on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX, I received a call from Bridgecrest stating that they needed to speak to the new lender due to the checks having some issues and they wanted me the customer to contact the new lender for them. I obviously was unable to speak to anyone at XXXX  or XXXX  due to the time I initially received the call. I suggested to XXXX that, they normally make contact with the lenders with regards to checks and that has nothing to do with me so I advised they continue to try to contact XXXX  or XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my vehicle was repossessed without warning. When I spoke to Bridgecrest they stated it was due to lack of payment, which made no sense as I hadn\\'t been notified that my vehicle was at risk of repossession. I think made several attempts on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX to resolve the situation with XXXX along with XXXX involved in the matter with no avail. As Bridgecrest, constantly was stalling telling me that there was no one that could verify the check being received back in XX/XX/XXXX, yet I was never given an option to speak to anyone who had knowledge on fixing the situation. I was constantly referred to having to \" wait \\'\\' until a manager can resolve the issue. However, here I am 9 days since the repossession and no further along in getting a clear understanding from Bridgecrest. The only thing I\\'m told it\\'s my fault to keep the account current, which has no standing since the account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX, but yet reopened by Bridgecrest. This company received a payout 3 months ago and this issue is still not resolved. Bridgecrest is without a doubt the most incompetent and fraud ridden finance company in existence.',\n",

At this time, a check with Navy Federal was not received. The XXXX XXXX XXXX was financed under XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I was hit by two vehicles causing my car to be totaled. XXXX took possession of the vehicle on XX/XX/XXXX. I called and spoke with a Navy Federal Member Service Representative. I informed the representative that my car was totaled so there was no need to move forward with the alleged agreement. I told her that I no longer needed the check I was supposed to pick up from my XXXX XXXX. The Representative informed me that it was still in my best interest to obtain the check and send it to XXXX XXXX XXXX regardless of the condition of my car. During that phone call, we arranged for said check to come in the mail using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The check was delivered XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX received the check XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX was fully aware that my car was damaged before they check was sent out. Taking the advice of the representative has caused me problems financially. Im unable to use my Navy Federal account. Navy Federal has added two past due payments to my account, they have added late fees and they also charged my savings account {$20.00} because Navy Federal was not listed as the first lien holder. Now, Im dealing with late fees, and harassment from Navy Federal trying to collect an alleged debt. The first alleged payment was due XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by XXXX insurance adjuster stating that the value of the car was {$16.00}, XXXX. XXXX has the check and has been ready for almost two months to send the check to Navy Federal. Ive communicated to Navy Federal on numerous occasions that I will not be making payments on a car that is no longer in my possession, especially since there is a check ready for Navy Federal. Navy Federal needs to do what is required by XXXX to obtain the check. If Navy FederaXXXX didnt take over the alleged payments from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the car would have been paid off almost two months ago. \\nSpeaking with a Lawyer, looking into my options, I found that there were violations made by Navy Federal on the alleged contract/promissory note. These Violations voids the alleged contract. According to the Promissory note, Navy Federal follows the Truth in Lending Act.\\n\\nIn the Truth in Lending act, under Title 15 U.S. Code 1605, the Finance Charge in connection with any consumer credit transaction is the SUM OF ALL CHARGES. That includes late fees and lien fees from any title company. According to the contract/promissory note with Navy Federal XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is {$3100.00}. According to the Truth in Lending Act and the Federal Law, {$3100.00} is the only amount Im allegedly responsible for paying if this wasnt a consumer credit transaction. Also, under Title 15, 1605 ( 5 ) ( B ), Navy federal did not include insurance in the finance charge. XXXX insurance was charged separately. Also stated under U.S. Code 1605 ( b ) ( 1 ) and I quote charges or premiums for credit life, accident, or health insurance written in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be included in the finance charges unless the coverage of the debtor by the insurance is not a factor in the approval by the creditor of the extension of credit, and this fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the person applying for or obtaining the extension of credit ;. This statement proves that I am the Creditor extending credit to Navy Federal.\\n\\nNavy Federal pointed out in the Returned Loaned Payment Fee section of the alleged promissory note that under ( Section 1014, Title 18, U.S. Code, makes it a federal crime to knowingly make a false statement. Navy federal has willingly and knowingly BROKE THE LAW!\\n\\nPursuant to Title 18 U.S. Code 8, the term obligation or the other security of the United States, includes all Federal Reserve bank, Federal Reserve notes, bills, coupons, checks, drafts for money, certificates of deposit and, etc. This alleged debt under alleged promissory note is to be the obligation of the United States not the consumer. \\nPursuant to 12 U.S. Code 1431 banks can not loan money.\\n\\nPursuant to Title 15, U.S. Code 1635 ( 4 ), the Right to Rescind shall apply to all consumer credit transactions. The Right to Rescind was not included on the Promissory Note. Navy Federal NEVER sent me documents to Rescind. Again, you broke the law. According to the CFPB, 1026.23 ( f ), the Right to Rescission is only exempt to refinancing by the same creditor. \\nAccording to CFPB 1016.7, and Title 15, U.S Code 6802 ( b ) Navy Federal was supposed to provide a form of opt out notice to consumers. Navy Federal has never sent a form of opt out notice, via email, mail, or electronically. I am demanding that Navy Federal remove the account from all three major credit reporting agencies. That includes, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. \\nAccording to CFPB, 1026.13 Billing Error Resolution, I extended credit to Navy federal with my credit card under an open-end consumer credit transaction. So, there should not be monthly bills or monthly payments. When Navy Federal ran my social security number ( credit card ), alleged promissory note was paid in full. If Navy Federal claims this alleged loan/promissory note came from their Account, I demand that Navy Federal provides me with proof of the Accounting Ledger and, Im demanding proof of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principle ( GAAP ). This will determine if this alleged debt exist and is owed to Navy Federal. \\nI am specific in what Im demanding. Do not send a copy of the alleged Promissory Note. I have that document in my possession. Provide me with what I asked for exactly. If Navy Federal doesnt provide the documents Im demanding, Navy Federal satisfy the loan account as Paid in Full. Navy Federal also agrees to provide Paid in Full documents so the lien placed on the title of the XXXX XXXX XXXX is removed. \\nPursuant to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Title 15 U.S. Code 1692j ( a ) It is unlawful to furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer. Navy Federal has furnished deceptive forms illegally in the attempt to collect an alleged debt. Each law violated is a {$1000.00} charge owed to me. \\nPursuant to Title 15, U.S. Code 1692g, I as the consumer have a right to validate this alleged debt.\\n\\nPursuant to Title 15 U.S. Code 1692c. ( c ) I am notifying you in writing that I REFUSE to pay this alleged debt. I am demanding that you cease all ILLEGAL communication with me through all mediums. \\n\\nPursuant to Title 15 U.S. Code 1692c. ( c ) ( 2 ) I am invoking my specified remedy as a consumer, and as the original creditor. I am demanding all the following : 1. ) Remove Navy Federal Accounts from ALL consumer reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). Documentation needs to be provided. \\nXXXX. ) Send Accounting Ledger AND XXXX documents by mail AND via email. \\nXXXX. ) Close the LOAN account as satisfied and paid in full providing proof of payment. You do not have permission to close my checking or savings account. \\nXXXX. ) Return the {$20.00} taken from my savings account to satisfy the lien on the title. This was taken without my permission. Breaking the Federal Law voids contract/promissory note. \\nThe CFPB, among other Entities will be receiving this letter, including the documents I want to upload with my complaint. Failure to comply, will result in Litigation. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, By law, I requested that this consumer credit transaction be disputed and that further interest be stopped. Navy Federal broke the law, denied my dispute and is currently reporting negatively to my consumer credit report. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I just received an email from my XXXX Account letting know that potentially negative information from Navy Federal is reflecting in my account which caused me to lose XXXX points. According to the FDCPA, while a dispute is in process, the company is not allowed to update any new information. Navy Federal deliberately ignored my request and broke',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Beginning of last month, I called Ally Financial XXXX to get a loan to payoff my lease. I informed them that my nephew and I were looking to submit a joint application because he is in need of a vehicle and is building his credit, but he has never obtained an auto loan. \\n\\nWe provided all of our personal information ( ssn, income, addresses, etc. ) asked by the Ally representative. The Ally representative then said that if we were to get a loan jointly that I would be required to be on the auto insurance policy which I am not sure why that mattered. At this point, I felt reluctant to go any further with the application because we were not calling Ally for information on auto insurance coverage. However, my nephew was still hopeful and anxious, so we continued with the application. During the call, I told the Ally representative he was wrong because as long as one party ( borrower or co-borrower ) is listed on the Title they can get sole auto insurance coverage. The Ally representative placed me on hold to check if what I said was legit only to return to the call to tell me I was right which was a complete waste of our time. Thereafter, the Ally representative asked a series of questions pertaining to the amount we were looking to finance ; he was able to pull the payoff amount for my lease directly from Ally 's system he said, then he asked if we would like to include a down payment which we said yes, roughly {$2000.00} or {$3000.00} is what I believe we stated. The Ally representative did indicate that a down payment was not required, so we asked for preliminary figures for both ( down payment and no down payment ). My nephew and I determined that putting money down was the best route based on our financial needs and told the Ally representative that we would like to move forward. The Ally representative read a lengthy disclosure about pulling our credit that required us to give our consent in order to proceed which we did. The Ally representative stated he would submit our application to underwriting for review, he said they ( underwriting ) will review our credit and income to make a credit decision. I did mention to the Ally representative that my neighbor bumped into the passenger door while the car was in park and the vehicle is scheduled to get repairs in late XXXX because that's the soonest XXXX XXXX could find an appointment slot in our area. \\n\\nA few days later, the Ally representative called back asking me if I would like to get a loan without adding my nephew and he was alluding to me proceeding with the application as a straw purchase which by definition, is an illegal transaction as I had clearly explained our loan purpose upfront. The Ally representative asked if my nephew has credit established and my response to him was to pull our credit reports and see for yourself as I thought that was the whole purpose of gathering our information for underwriting 's review. The Ally representative said they at Ally didn't want to do a hard credit report pull only to find out that my nephew doesn't have enough credit to prove loan worthiness and the pull would lower our credit scores, like they were doing us a favor. \\n\\nI felt so disgusted and discriminated against because none of the expectations that were stated upfront nor the terms and conditions explained in the verbal disclosure ( s ) actually took place. To this day, we never received a declination letter from Ally nor was our credit report ever pulled. To my understanding, this is a Regulation B violation. From the start of the call, it seemed like Ally was looking to find reasons to not submit our application and/or intimidate us to not move forward with pursuing a loan with them and I never missed a payment with Ally. We provided our information in good faith and under the impression that the application process would be seamless. \\n\\nToday, I got a letter in the mail from Ally stating to turn the car in or they'll recover it. I called the phone number provided on the letter and I have to pay for a lease extension until the car repairs are completed and have agreed to keep the vehicle insured at least until the repairs are completed, but I am not happy with Ally at all.\",\n",

During my talks with Drivetime I discovered they put out a repossession out for my vehicle the same day they received my complaint which I believe is in retaliation and in violation of Illinois  Consumer Fraud Act. 815 ILCS 505  and makes them liable for damages. Drivetime has behaved in a way that businesses should not behave when dealing with legitmate comcerns or complaints. During this time it was revealed that my account was sold and Drivetime no longer was the creditor of my account and they have yet failed to disclose who has my account. I have security alerts and fraud protection on my credit as I 'm in the process of trying to rebuild my credit and know that hard inquiries can be very negative as they are an important part of your credit. Upon receiving an email alerting my to a change on my report I 'm quite shocked to discover that Drivetime has pulled my credit report resulting in a hard inquiry. I have not given Drivetime permission to pull my credit or any authorization to do anything with my credit and cause m y credit score to dr op. Since I have filed my complaint against Drivetime they have and are continuing to do illegal and frauduently activities to retaliate against me and have made themselves liable for any legal actions that will allow me to remedy this situation. Hard inquiries generally occur when a financial institution, such as a lender or credit card issuer, checks your credit report when making a lending decision. They commonly take place when you apply for a loan, credit card or mortgage, and you typically have to authorize them. The Fair Credit Reporting Act and some state credit reporting laws set forth the basic rules that protect your credit information. These laws allow only certain entities to gain access to your credit report in certain situations. They also restrict how your credit information can be used. Sometimes individuals and businesses pull your report when they have no legal basis to do soand this is called having an impermissible purpose. If the person requesting your credit report does not  have one of the  permissible purposes, then your credit report is off limits. If you believe that somebody wrongfully pulled your credit report, you may be able to sue them in state or federal court for damages. I have fraud alerts set in place that if any activity occurs on my account I 'm notified and any application for credit the company must contact me to take verification steps. I do n't know how Drivetime was able to pull my credit report as I was not trying to obtain any form of credit with them and I have alerts in place. Drivetime is being very malicious in the ways they have repeatedly handled this situation since I 've filed my disputes. Drivetime has come up with their own set of rules that are invalid or did n't exist prior to me filing a complaint. In pulling my credit report Drivetime was to use my information as an unfair advantage in negotiations. In violation of the FCRA I 'm entitled to damages including punitive because Drivetime is deliberately trying to use illegal and fraudulently tactics when trying to come to a settlement regarding this complaint. Consumers should n't feel threaten or fear when filing a complaint against a company out of fear they may face repercussions. I felt threaten and it was an intimidating experience when talking to Drivetime regarding my vehicle as I was repeatedly told that if I did n't meet his terms they would put out a repossession for my vehicle. In filling my complaint I was hoping to get a resolution and not have my life invaded fraudulently, repossession, and causing harm to my credit as I try to rebuild something that is so sacred.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'When I bought my XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX in Missouri, I was conned into trading in my car, getting less then half the trade was worth. They added a service contract that I never asked for which cost XXXX $ I had problems left and right with the vehicle, and the warranty the service contract came with. Hasnt covered any of the cars issues that they claim are not covered, but when I call the warranty company they are. When I signed the paperwork I asked before signing why is there 2 amounts on the document, they assured me I was paying the XXXX. The listing price for the car was that much, I got approved and then at the last minute when I was finished signing the paper work the lender they said that approved me changed there mind. They then magically found Santander USA and charged me 25 % casual interest. Now Im paying XXXX for a car thats worth XXXX if that anymore. I didnt want the car at that point and they told me that I couldnt get out of the contract due to signing it. When they mailed me the title to the car, the bill of sale, title and legal documents were for a car that I didnt purchase. It took them months to finally get me the needed proper documentation to legally show Im owner of the property. I just need help refinancing. I dont feel it was within my constitutionally protected rights. I never agreed to be financed thru Santander. But the I was scared into believing when they said even if I broke the contract and ended it, I would still owe for the loan on the car.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"On XX/XX/XXXX I was asked to co-sign/borrow for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX from XXXX XXXX. As this is a subprime loan the APR is 20.58 %, {$11000.00} finance charge, making the {$15000.00} financed, that amount includes {$290.00} for Gap Addendum Waiver into {$27000.00} total. We had signed a contract earlier in the week for a XXXX that was {$5000.00} less but XXXX XXXX XXXX turned down that loan but approved the higher loan. \\nI told the sales manager that I did not want to get into a loan with over {$11000.00} in interest, that is a whole other car and I am on Social Security XXXX  and not comfortable with being responsible for it. The manager came in and assured me that the loan could be refinanced without me after a year of good payments, but what he did not say is no one will refinance a car that is over 10 years old and it turned 10 a  week after signing the contract. If I had known that fact I would have never put myself in this kind of debt. \\nOn XXXX XXXX a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX stated that the payment from the dealership on behalf of your addendum has not been received. And it is their understanding that the payment will not be sent. And the dealership would be responsible for the Gap waiver should there be a total loss. \\nAfter paying for more than a year and a half on XX/XX/XXXX we went to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they gave us a XXXX that we did not see, showing an accident report that we were not told about and potential odometer rollback indicated and they would only give {$3000.00} in trade. \\nI tried to call the dealership but they had closed down by then. On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint with the OCCC and they closed it without sending me any of the proof, I asked for them and in the documents XXXX sent on XXXX XXXX was an inspection for the car dated XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX miles and on XX/XX/XXXX dealer inventory on my XXXX shows XXXX and I have an odometer disclosure with XXXX. From XXXX through XXXX there is a XXXX mile difference. \\nAlso they sent a document that says Gap Addendum Waiver that we have never seen. The information shows the car as NEW and msrp as {$60000.00}, and the signature of the borrower is a forge, you can clearly tell the signature looks like the sales manager who signed next to it. The name is spelled wrong and the numbers for the date is not how either of us right, I am not even on it but I drive the car. With it came a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to whom it may concern there is an active policy, when I pulled the policy up it is just a typed document not signed and dated. \\nI started calling XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX asking what the odometer reading is on the title because we have still have not received a receipt and she asked me, don't I know how many miles my car has, I said I want the miles OFF the title and she said they didn't have it there and to go to the DMV. \\nBy XX/XX/XXXX we were getting a letter from First Investors Financial Services saying we were to pay them now. On XX/XX/XXXX I did a title search and on titlecheck.us the NMVTIS vehicle history report shows the mileage as exempt, and the Power of Attorney we signed can not be used if the car is subject to federal odometer disclosure statement. The application for Texas title does not show exempt it has mileage and the county of title issuance the dealer filled out. I sent a complaint to DMV on XX/XX/XXXX and the investigator said the miles were just typos by the inspection stations and the business closed so they can't do anything. \\nI contacted First Investors Financial Services in XX/XX/XXXX and asked the same question about mileage with no response. I finally sent emails to the higher ups and explained the situation and that the sale is void under Texas Transportation code chapter 501 sec.501.073. He asked me was I wanting to voluntarily surrender the car, no I do not, this is no fault of ours and my credit is excellent now and will not except it on my credit and our remedy is to have the contract cancelled and they take the car.\\n\\nHe said they disagree and the car is exempt because it is 10. As I told him, the car was 9 when we signed the contract and that they have a copy of the odometer statement and the title receipt they sent me shows miles as N/A. There has been no reply in 2 weeks. \\nI am afraid they are about to do as XXXX and sell my contract and I have to go through more. \\nI know there is a violation of the DTPA, Texas Transportation code, Texas Financial code, Federal Odometer Act, Business and Commerce code. Stallion lied to the OCCC. And they sent the OCCC a bill of sale from the auction and they paid a little over {$8000.00} but I am paying {$27000.00} for the same car! And it does not matter if I pay early they are charging more finance charge each time, which my contract says the finance charge would be less. \\nWe just want out of something we would have never gotten into if not for being led by the manager. We have already had to replace the transmission and the headlight twice in the first year and have paid 3 years on a car with no clean title.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I refinanced my car with XXXX XXXX and the payoff check has been sent in twice now, neither time has the check been cashed and I've received Calls demanding payment or telling me that my credit score will be compromised and my car repossessed despite the fact that the company is simply not cashing the buyout checks. The first buyout check was sent in XXXX, was not cashed and therefore after a month a stop payment was placed on that check. Another check was sent to them on XXXX and I have confirmed receipt on XXXX from my refinance company who has the tracking information from XXXX that it was delivered. I am told that the hold up is because my refinance company hasn't issued a new check which is false. I also was contacted by Bridgecrest to inform me that the check was received and that there was a {$140.00} or so difference between the check and the actual buyout amount which I paid over the phone and was told that my account was resolved. You can even see on my loan payment history that the buyout check was applied and then removed and further late fees were assessed after that happened as well. My refinance company tells me that they have a number of clients that this very same situation is happening to with regard to refinance from Bridgecrest specifically and frankly it feels like retaliation for refinancing my vehicle. I need this issue to be resolved with no detriment to my credit. I am being fed contradictory information from my original financer ( Bridgecrest ) and my new financer company ( XXXX XXXX ) is very frustrated at this situation as well as they are dealing with a number of accounts experiencing this exact issue.\",\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX i purchased a used vehicle WFDS issued me the loan and i accepted it. My payments were XXXX per month. I paid my monthly payments till after around 13 or 14 months later WFDS decided that my insurance wasn ; t good enough and issued me their own insurance. Everything got very confusing my payments changed, as to even in XX/XX/XXXX they made me pay XXXX. I said i dont understand why the XXXX their reply was your payment raised i paid it then they wanted me to pay XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX on top of XXXX the new payment they raised me to. I could not make the payment which forced me into falling behind. I was looking at repossession now. On XX/XX/XXXX WFDS accepted another XXXX told me that i would be fine with the repossession and in the meantime a truck pulled up in front of my house trying to repossess the car, they were unable to do it that day since the car was in the mechanic shop. That forced me into doing a Bankruptcy to get protection from the Federal Judge. I received my protection. In the meantime WFDS has instated wrong information on my credit report for the last 3 years or more, wrong dates, wrong amounts, and a separate account for their insurance. I have not tried to resolve this before because my husband has been very ill for the last 4 years, undergoing extensive XXXX, but today hes doing much better, and i am here trying to resolve this matter.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/2020, I reached out to Wells Fargo in an attempt to refinance a current vehicle loan. After a hard inquiry on my credit, I was informed that I was approved and given my new monthly payment along with APR. I was told to check my mail as I would receive correspondence that way and to continue to make normal payments. After a few months I had not received anything nor did I receive emails or phone calls. On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Wells Fargo to inquire about the delay. The first representative \" XXXX \\'\\' informed me that Wells Fargo was no longer exercising refinance options for customers and that I should take my business to another financial institution. I asked to be forwarded to a supervisor and upon transfer was hung up on. After calling back, I asked to be transferred to where they were attempting to transfer me to which was the escalation department. After a brief transfer and a long pause, someone answered the phone with the greeting, \" hello \\'\\' without identifying themselves. I explained my situation and stated my desire to have the hard inquiry removed from my credit since my refinance was not going to be honored. The escalation employee told me that I needed to write someone else within Wells Fargo despite being forwarded to the correct department able to handle my inquiry. The representative seemed to have had the impression that it was my fault that my refinance did not work out despite myself being informed by the previous representative that refinance options ceased on XX/XX/2020, which meant I was only given three days to respond to correspondence I never received. The escalation employee informed me that they attempted to call my cell phone but only got the busy signal. I find that hard to believe as my cell phone is always on me and always on therefore they would have never gotten a busy signal and I do believe this was an error on their part as they have the correct mailing address on file for me.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'In XXXX of XXXX I refinanced a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was using XXXX XXXX and had gotten a better rate from Capital One so decided to make the switch. About 6 months ago the car was totaled so we started the process of getting our payout as Capitol One owed us about {$4500.00} due to the car being worth more then our loan amount. I was working with my insurance company ( XXXX ) to get the payout but the day the agent was coming by to give me the check she said there was a problem with the bank, meaning Capitol One. We had a rental but that was limited to 30 days so at the end of that I needed to empty my saving account to buy my wife a car in cash. Come to find out Capital One had never received the perfected title because they failed to submit documents. I have called them every week for these 6 months now to see if there is anything they need to make sure we can get this issue resolved. They are quite incompetent because every time I call the person says they will send and email to the back people to see what the holdup is but nothing ever comes of it and I just end up calling the week after to get the same response. They forgot basic paperwork that is needed to register a car in their name. Once they forgot the Title Application, then they forgot to get the old registration from me before submitting paperwork. They tried getting a release of lien and failed at that so I stepped up and called my old lender to get things sorted. They were able to provide a release of lien but then it was back to Capitol One. Most recently I submitted a document and have been waiting 4 weeks for them to resubmit the document \\'s to the XXXX but I am always told they are in \" review \\'\\' even though it is simply an old registration. At this point Capitol One owes me over {$6000.00} as I have still needed to make payments on the car. I am here to try and get them moving because I could really use that money and I feel they are either ignoring my case or are just that bad at their job.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"After purchasing the XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX, XXXX DE in XXXX of XXXX, I agreed to lease the vehicle with American Finance Company. After test driving the vehicle, I noticed that they had the air conditioning blasting in mid- XXXX. The car drove great, and there were no indication lights on. After driving it off the lot, I turned off the air. In two days, the engine light came on, and so I took it back to XXXX Co. The mechanic stated that there was a small part on the engine the size of a pea that was bad. I had a warranty on the vehicle. American Finance immediately stated that I had to take the car to their service station. Which I did. After a week or so I picked up the vehicle. Soon after, American Finance called and stated they needed to place a device inside of the car. Right after that, I drove the car, and there wasn't any light on, and then a few weeks later, the engine light came on again. I called the warranty station, and they stated that the warranty had expired. I took it to auto zone, and they stated something about the coolant pack, and that they couldn't read the codes. I took it to a mechanic, and they took the car apart, and still couldn't find what was wrong with it. I kept putting coolant in the car, and nothing worked. By this time, I had already paid American Finance XXXX, and the car total was XXXX. I told them several times, after purchasing the vehicle that something was wrong with it, and that their company didn't fix the car. They stated, 'well that really your problem. The car would break down in odd places, and frequently. American Finance picked up the broken car with my things inside. While at their gated facility, they broke the window in my car, and some of my personal items were stolen. They called me the next day, and told me about it. I asked them how did someone break a window in a tightly secured gated parking lot? They gave their apologies, and stated that they would repair the window. I also find this to be criminal. At the end of the story, I requested the remaining balance to be voided due to the car being a lemon. They then harassed me afterwards, and stated no, youre going to pay for the vehicle, as they sent garnishment for my wages. I believe the company intentionally sold me a car that wasn't any good, and that they also didn't fix the car, after I took it to their repair shop. I'm asking the courts to diminish the wage garnishment, and void the remaining balance on the vehicle. I will be pursuing this further as I believe, that they intentionally sold me a vehicle that wasn't operable. Attached I have a receipt and picture of the XXXX XXXX diagnoses, and also the reference from the mechanic that service the vehicle. To add to the evidence, I had asked American Finance if I could have one last mechanic take a look at it, and they stated, '' absolutely not. If someone could please look into this matter, as I have been harassed by them on a constant basis. They are charging me judgment fees, and interest, which totals XXXX 'm asking the courts to delete this payment to {$0.00} due to them selling me a car that was a lemon, and not operable, and not fixing the car. Also, for criminal activity that they performed while the vehicle was in their procession. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX vs American Finance, LLC Thank you.\",\n",

Dealership could not work with my local credit union since it was in another state and secured financing through TD Auto. I refinanced the vehicle through XXXX XXXX XXXX in late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX. In the process of applying for a new mortgage, I pulled my credit report and see that TD Auto is showing a {$44.00} balance. TD Auto has been less than forthcoming and somewhat deceptive. They tell me that they have no record of quoting a 10 day payoff, but they are telling me that when they received the payoff from XXXX, it was 3 days late. XXXX has records showing the check was mailed in plenty of time, but TD Auto has been unwilling to work with me and waive the {$44.00} fee. XXXX XXXX has said that do not waive these fees. Then they said they can not. Then finally they said that they just don't want to. They have me over a barrel for {$44.00} on a {$70000.00} loan and are unwilling to work with their customer. They have also been unwilling to expedite this account updating on my credit report and unwilling to provide me with a letter showing this has been paid off. My mortgage broker wants this to show as paid off & closed on my credit report to boost my score a few points and secure me a better interest rate. I may end up paying a higher interest rate because TD Auto does not care about their customers.\",\n",

I began the refinancing process in XX/XX/XXXX and was approved by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I received a payoff check from them to sign and send to American Honda Financial, which I did. \\n3. My payoff check was sent to American Honda Financial XX/XX/XXXX and received XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the refinancing company, that the check was then cashed on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n4. I received no contact from Honda Financial until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with Customer Service XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She informed me of what happened with my payoff check - that the account number was not present on the check and that because the last name on the check did not match the last name on my HF account. She informed me to send my marriage license to XXXX, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a confirmation email or phone call that my marriage license had been received via email. NOTE : It was during this time that myself and my husband tested positive for XXXX ( I have proof of positive test results if needed ) and were in quarantine. I was very sick and my mobility was limited ). \\n5. I had a payment due with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I made the payment to them as I assumed that everything would be resolved with Honda Financial, they would apply the payoff amount and I would be fine moving forward. \\n6. I got a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX from HF indicating that my acct was still past due. I spoke to the representative XXXX and told her about the ongoing issue. She was the first to inform me that the marriage license had NOT been received. I re-sent it that day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to XXXX with attention to XXXX. \\n7. I looked into having to pay my monthly note to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX y, and the loan balance was {$0.00}. This was on a weekend so I had to wait until at least XX/XX/XXXX to speak to customer service from AHF. \\n8. I spoke with XXXX for the first time the week of XX/XX/XXXX. She was very pleasant and helpful. I wanted the issue resolved. We had an extensive conversation where I expressed my displeasure with the way the incident had been handled as well as the lack of communication to XXXX, the consumer. She acknowledged that someone in her department should have contacted me and apologized for the lack of communication and that she was going to make sure everything got resolved for me. XXXX expressed frustration because the marriage license that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX was not processed and used to update the last name on my account. This was not communicated to me by the Customer Service Representative XXXX that received the email on XX/XX/XXXX. Also, my marriage license was the only document I\\'d ever been asked to send in. If additional information was needed to update my last name, no one ever told me. XXXX told me that she was \" Just going to put it through \\'\\' and assured me that my last name had been updated. I trusted that she would help. \\n9. I was also informed from XXXX that American Honda Financial sent back the payoff check from XXXX XXXX. I remember this because she remarked that it was odd they paid themselves off \" with their own check. \\'\\' 10. XXXX instructed me to speak with the refinance company and give her a call back. I told her I would. I asked for her direct number so that I wouldn\\'t have to go through customer service and to get the matter resolved more efficiently. She was unable to provide a direct number. I did inform her that I was still behind and very busy catching up with work and other obligations after recovering from XXXX but I would do my best to get back to her quickly. \\n11. NOTE : From my first time speaking with XXXX, I only spoke with her as she said she would be handling the issue for me. There was no conversation where XXXX ever indicated that I needed to make a payment to Honda Financial to avoid repossession. No customer service representative indicated that their calls were an attempt to collect a debt or that my account was that delinquent.\\n\\n12. I spoke with XXXX XXXX the week of XX/XX/XXXX. I was sent documentation from them showing proof that American Honda Finance had not sent back the payoff check as XXXX reported to me. Instead, they created a whole new check to send to XXXX XXXX. XXXX had previously informed me that XXXX XXXX paid themselves \" with their own check. \\'\\' As it turns out, this was FALSE. It must be noted that XXXX XXXX received this check from AHF AFTER I had emailed my marriage license to AHF so that they could apply the original payoff check from XXXX XXXX to my account. \\n13. I attempted to contact XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but was unable to call during AHF business hours due to the difference in time zones. I planned to call the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, but my child was sick and I was unable to call. \\n14. The morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I came outside to my car being completely gone. Thinking it was stolen, I contacted XXXX who informed me that car companies are supposed to inform XXXX Police that a car is being repossessed. The car had not been reported as repossessed to the police, so I moved forward with a police report and statement. I called to speak to XXXX during business hours and she will no longer take my call. I also spoke to other customer service representatives, who told me to contact the Recovery department to handle my issue, but did not give me the phone number for the Recovery Department. The communication and customer service ( up to my first time speaking with XXXX ) has been XXXX XXXX. \\n15. At no point in any conversation did XXXX ( or any other representative ) ASK if I was able to make a payment or that a payment of a certain amount was needed to get the account current. She made me feel as though everything would be resolved. I thought the process was simply to get my name updated on my AHF account so that AHF could receive the funds from the original payoff check and complete the refinance process. If I had known my car was in danger of being TAKEN, I would have done everything I could to prevent this from happening.\\n\\n16. My credit has now been RUINED beyond repair and AHF is at fault.\\n\\n17. This whole situation feels EXTREMELY predatory, as if AHF wanted to keep me locked into a high car note/high interest rate so they botched my refinance and now that my credit is destroyed, I am stuck with them or without a car. I am reporting all of this to the CFPB and XXXX.',\n",

XXXX congratulated me for paying off the car and said it should take 6-8 weeks to receive my title. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo because It had been 5 months and I still had not received the title. I was transferred XXXX at the office of the President she stated that I still had a balance of {$270.00}. and 3 days earlier they charged -off my loan. I was furious, I insisted I did not want that on my credit report and paid it in full. XXXX took the payment over the phone during that call, I gave her my debit card acct number paid {$270.00}. \\n\\nXXXX stated that my car loan was reported late 4 months and the charge off was reported to the credit bureau. That is UNFAIR!

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'The short version of my complaint is that I firmly believe that XXXX/Ally purposefully refused to return my phone calls to complete the approval on my lease buyout loan so that they could turn around and deny it after the original approval expired. I firmly believe they are being discriminative towards me for a reason that I am still trying to figure out. They have continuously misled me and they have dragged this process on for almost two months now. I also firmly believe that they are either discriminating against me as a person or if not they are purposefully dragging out this process so that I owe them lease extension fees once they completely deny the loan. Here is the longer explanation of the last two months : Back on XX/XX/XXXX I decided to purchase my lease at the end of the contract. I went through all the steps that day with XXXX XXXX at XXXX/Ally to apply for financing. He took down all of my information and went over all the steps and the process. He said it would take a day or two to get the approval back and we ended the call. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from XXXX/Ally called me back to tell me that the loan to buy out the lease was approved and he said he was initiating the online portal for me where I could go in and drop all of the documents needed such as pay stubs, etc. I verbally accepted the offer and a day or two later I uploaded all of the needed documents to the online portal. It was after then that all of the trouble started. All of a sudden I stopped receiving phone calls from XXXX/Ally and when I would call to follow up they would just tell me that everything looks good and I have done all that is needed. In a few days I should see the closing documents online for me to sign. They offered to mail them but I said online is best for me. A few more days went by and I heard nothing so I called in again for an update at which time I was told that someone named XXXX was my new loan consultant and they transferred me to her. XXXX gave me the same info, that the process will take some time but assured me the loan was approved and they were working on drawing up my closing docs. Yet again a few more days passed with no communication from XXXX/ally and there were often times I would call and could not even get though to a loan consultant because of high call volumes. I would never let more than 3-4 days go by without following up with XXXX. Now we are at X/XX/17 which is when I decided to record all of my phone calls and communication with XXXX/Ally as I felt they were deliberately not returning my phone calls for whatever reason. I called in on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told I needed to speak to the credit department to verify some information. I was transferred to the department and they simply asked me to verify some basic information. The gentleman said he was going to transfer me to a loan consultant now but they were busy so he would have someone call me back by noon on X/XX/17. X/XX/17 at XXXX comes around and there is no phone call from XXXX/Ally. I called in later that afternoon to ask for an update and I was transferred to XXXX XXXX who said there was strangely no loan consultant assigned to my file. I told here I was working with XXXX and then XXXX but XXXX said that she would just take in my file to finish it up since she can see its been a long process. She said the loan was approved and she could see that I already uploaded all of my documents to the portal. She would work on finishing up my file and get the closing docs drawn and then call me the next day to update me. XX/XX/XXXX No call back from XXXX/Ally again so I called in again to ask for an update. XXXX no available. I continued to call in every couple of days only to be told that a loan consultant would call me back soon. I eventually asked to speak to a manager because im never getting a call back when im told that I would. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX which is when XXXX XXXX finally returned my phone call. She told me that she is prepping the closing docs and I would definitely see them on the web on a few days and that she would follow up with me. She apologized for the bad communication and blamed it on the fact they are really backed up and its a separate dept that draws docs. XX/XX/XXXX Im still waiting for the closing docs and a call back from XXXX. I am being patient since she said they are really backed up. I get a call today from a customer service rep who says. Your loan has been approved and we would like to talk about the offer that we have for you. I said OK but I already had an application approved so he transferred to XXXX, who I had worked with once before. She told me that it was a duplicate loan and to just ignore it and that she would delete it. She confirmed she could see the original loan in the system and that everything was fine. I asked her to email XXXX XXXX to call me back when she could. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX calls me later that day and says Yeah I had to redo the loan but it was no big deal and she would call me back as soon as she is able to correct the duplicate loan issue. She promised me that she would call me back in two days or less. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX calls me back ( First time she/XXXX/ally has ever returned my phone call ) and she told me that She received an answer back from the lender ( ally ) and the application was denied. I immediately got upset and told her that the loan was already approved and when I talked to her last week she was drawing closing docs as if the loan was already done. After asking more questions XXXX finally revealed that the original application that was approved had expired and she had to submit a new one and that one was denied but could not tell me why. I immediately asked to speak to a manager who  said they would look into the file further. He said he would call me back by EOD on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX No phone call back, of course, so I called in and explained the situation only to be placed on hold for 40 minutes. I could not wait so I hung up and called back on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX Called in and I was told the person I talked to, XXXX, worked in the CA office and they were not in yet. The rep was sending an email to him to have him call me when he got in. XX/XX/XXXX Never got a call from XXXX so I called in asking for an update and another manager told me that they were working with Ally managers to clear up the issue and they would call me back in a day or so. XX/XX/XXXX No phone call back again So I called in and spoke to XXXX XXXX who said the app was declined. I asked for more information as I was confused why, after all the issues, he was just simply saying its declined. I was asking for more information and he was very vague and would give me zero information on the decline. I asked him why would it be approved on the original application and not on the second application that I didnt know was being submitted. I mentioned that I had no idea my credit was being ran again and that I did not give permission for that credit pull. He just kept being very vague and dodging my questions. He did says he would start some fires and find out what changed to cause the decline. He mentioned I needed to contact ally to find out why it was declined. XX/XX/XXXX Called the lease buy out dept at ally and gave a short version of my issues and that I was directed to call them. The lady was very confused and said there was nothing she could do and she was unable to answer my questions. She was confused why XXXX divison would tell me to call an ally department directly because there is just nothing she can do. She was drafting an email to upper management on the issue and said I would receive a call the same day, if not the next business day. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Currently still waiting for a call back.',\n",

I have receiving threatening letters and emails demanding the following documentation .when I call the Branch it go straight to customer service to which I get the run around to whom I am supposed to speak to.On XXXX XX/XX/22, I finally had a chance to speak with someone who was trying to assist me young lady called that particular branch in XXXX she stated she spoke to the branch manager her response was that all titles get mailed out to California once they received, so I explain to her I was there on XXXX XX/XX/22 today is XXXX XX/XX/22 .The title company in California is still stating that they dont have my title!! The manager also stated customer service agent who is in charge of mailing the titles to XXXX was not available that day and she was unaware on how to retrieve them to assist us To which I found to be totally unacceptable if shes a branch manager!!!! ( ( ( No names ) ) ) were given upon request!!!! at the time of the conversation but Im quite sure it was properly documented. So today XX/XX/1922, I had the pleasure of speaking with a young lady by the name of ( ( XXXX XXXX ) ) Who also explains to me that no documentations where received but she went above and beyond and tried to get the matter expedited she was unable to complete the matter and she stated to me I should go back out to the Pen Fed location in XXXX Maryland which is an hour and 45 minutes almost 2 hours away from my home!!!! request to speak to the branch manager and the young lady to whom I gave the documents to and also that an extension has been placed on my account!!!! which I told her which is extremely unacceptable to me as a consumer because Ive done everything I was supposed to do on my part .so I was to not be penalized or need a waiver placed on my account for something that was done by Pen Fed s negligence me and my husband have been paying on this loan since XXXX XXXX With no knowledge that the proper documentation was not processed until recently me and my husband deserve answers and this is so disheartening and so unacceptable from such a XXXX XXXX XXXX something needs to be done about this matter and all of the Managers and employees involved. Ive submitted documentation to the CFPB today and I also submitted documentation over to the FTC. So me and my husband is hoping for a prompt response To which this is and may affect our credit since the interest rate is at stake due to the fact that Pen Fed is stating that they did not receive proper documentation our next step is to reach out to our attorney.',\n",

He told me nobody called me back ( in person in front of my face/spouse and minor child ) from XXXX XXXX ( after being promised a call back in XX/XX/2018 ) because my credit was bad, stating that nobody wanted to deal with me.

I declined the deal, actually coming in today with a spouse to co sign. Keep in mind we never signed any documents to consent for the credit check which is concerning. XXXX went on to degrading me verbally the entire evening, constantly saying that my \" bad credit \\'\\' was the reason nobody in the dealership called me back. He cursed all night long, even trying to force my spouse to agree to a contract she did not agree to. He even stated that he would not forward our application to Honda Financial unless we agreed to the service contract/GAP insurance, attempting to manipulate us to agree with his terms, constantly telling us Honda will deny a deal unless the extended warranty was opted in by us. \\n\\nXXXX repeatedly talked me down in front of my spouse, telling her that the extended warranty protected her from me because based on my credit I would default payments, damaging her credit, according to XXXX. He even told me to apply elsewhere, telling me to \" go to your bank maybe they will approve you since you do not want the extended warranty added. \\'\\' Pre judging the joint application as if he was a legal licensed loan department representative. I am extremely offended and concerned with this behavior displayed tonight by this employee of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, California. I do not understand why me and my spouse were discouraged from proceeding with having our information submitted to Honda Financial.  Please advise.',\n",

At that point, I had my payment date to match my VA compensation payment date. In XXXX of XXXX, I made my payment over the telephone. At that time, I asked the customer representative why i was being reported to the credit bureaus. He informed that they report it ever month, and condescendingly said that i must use XXXX XXXX. He made it sound like was I ignorant and did not know what I was talking about. I had the same conversation several times throughout the past year. \\nI informed most of the customer representative I talked to that my first loan was there and closed, but the second was not there. I was always informed that it is automatically reported. \\nIn XXXX of this year, I wanted to try to get my truck refinanced to lower my interest rate. Finally someone agreed with me and saw that it was not being report and told me what to do. \\nI preceded to get a hold of the credit dispute team for Car Financial Services. I then got a letter in the mail from them stating that I was right it is no where to be fold on any of the credit bureaus. I requested that that it be posted and i was informed that the account ; as far as, the credit bureaus is concerned my account was closed and could not be reported. Why can they report one account a decide not to report the other. \\nI asked why it was closed and not being reported, i was informed that it was done last XXXX. Also, Car Financial Services didn't would not to post it. \\nYou see I wanted to accomplish 3 things. One. of my goal was to get a bad XXXX new truck that was done. the second goal was to try to improve my credit rating and get refinanced. Hoping that would improve my score enough to use my VA loan to buy my Mother 's property for her as a present. this was the third and finally thing. Now knowing that I can't accomplish any of things, I am some what XXXX. I don't remember being told that the account was never going to be reported. \\nI then was informed by the credit reporting team that they didn't have to tell me and it was their choice to report it or not. Which i found out to be true, I can't get my truck refinance and i will have to find another way to improve my score. The other option is to go ahead and file bankruptcy and start all over!\",\n",

One of the dealership employees showed me a car that he had outside of the dealership. That he was selling to me personally.I agreed to accepting that car and he continued to run my credit for Navy Federal Credit Union at the dealership on their computer. I was approved for about XXXX dollars. I was able to pick up the check from XXXX XXXX, pay the employee and accept the car. XX/XX/XXXX.  Months later I received a notification stating that I wasn't a member of the credit union and that I needed to provide more information to the bank. I went into the bank, provided multiple proofs of resident information, ID, and more documents. They accepted it, made copies etc. \\n\\n\\nWeeks later they're still asking me for information to verify that I am a member. They then told me that I couldn't refinance my car because I wasn't a member. They denied access to my entire profile. I was away at school in New York and couldn't even make payments online so I fell behind payments. I was only allowed to make payments physically. I spoke with a representative over the phone about the situation and they told me to write a letter. I wrote a letter and sent it to them. ( Dated : I stopped paying this institution because I feel like I was manipulated at a young age and it seems like it was an internal scam. Applying for the loan at the dealership, picking up a check days later, weeks later stating that I wasn't a member ) How was I not a member if I was approved for a loan? \\n\\nPlease help me. I am now in my mid twenties and this is affecting my credit score very badly. I spoke with another representative today XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) in the recovery department. He said I am a member and still need to provide identification? I do not want to be a member anymore. I would like for this loan to be deleted completely and sent to all of my credit bureaus for internal fraud. \\n\\n\\nXXXX XXXX ( The car dealership ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX, Virginia XXXX Get Directions Highlights info row image ( XXXX ) XXXX Navy Federal Credit Union XXXX Vehicle ending in XXXX\",\n",

I was informed that they do not refinance by the representative and shortly after that I started receiving missed payment notifications on my credit report. My credit score started off in the low XXXX 's and now is in the mid XXXX 's. The main reason as to why I called about refinancing was because my interest rate is high. I have worked diligently to change that and I have. I have called them on several different occasions on this matter but have had no response on this particular matter. No one will refinance me now because I show have recent late payments. I have paid my bill the same way since starting the loan. I never received any mail regarding in delinquencies on my account primarily because they have been reluctant to put real address on any of my mail. The dealership, Santander Consumer, and the credit bureaus all have been made aware of my address being incorrect. No entity has corrected it yet.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'To whom it may concern, Re : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Auto loan financed with Navy Federal Credit Union This is a formal complaint against Navy Federal Credit Unions Collateral Control dept. My husband and I had refinanced his truck through Navy Federal Credit Union XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX  at a much lower interest rate. At this time, we agreed to the terms and conditions of presenting a new title to Navy Federal with them listed as the new lien holder. In order to complete this we had to pay off the present loan with XXXXXXXX XXXX  and they would send us a lien release to take to the local agency to apply for the new title. I waited over a month for this to come in the mail and it never showed up. I called XXXX XXXX to follow up on the status of this. Their title department advised me they sent this to the corporate branch for Navy federal in Virginia. I was sent a letter and received a phone call from Navy Federal to bring a copy of our title up to the branch to have them scan into their system. At this time, I took off of work to go into the bank and have them scan the title. The title we had still name XXXX XXXX  as the lien holder which I explained to the lady at the XXXX XXXX OK branch, what was going on. She said thats okay if they have the lien, they are able to file for the new title on our behalf for a small fee. I okayed them to charge me the fee so that I wouldnt have to take more time off of work to get this completed. Another month went by I receive another letter from Navy saying they needed the new title. I took off of work again and drove to the bank in XXXX XXXX and called the customer service number to speak with someone in the title dept at Navy Federal who said she was noting the account really well of all our efforts and could see my prior calls that we are trying to resolve this matter and someone would call me back. I never received a returned call. When I got the Navy Federal, they lady said they didnt have a copy of the title. I explained once again what was going on, she apologized and asked that I give her the title to scan into the system again. She assured me this would be taken care of and she could see in the file they did have the lien release from XXXXXXXX XXXX Almost 2 more months went by I heard nothing until I receive an email and call from Navy Federal ( see email attached ) This email is advising me our loan interest rate will change if we do not take care of the issue. At this time, I called Navy federal again spoke with someone in title dept who said it may be best that I go up to branch to resolve this matter. I took off of work again, drove to XXXX XXXX Ok ( 40 mins away ) sat down with a branch representative who advised the lien release they have on file from XXXX XXXX was never signed therefore it was not valid. I asked her to call XXXX XXXX with me in the branch, she did ; I spoke with the XXXX XXXX title rep gave permission for them to speak with Navy Federal. At this time the Navy federal rep explained to them the copy they sent was not signed they need a new copy mailed out. She told them the send the copy to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX Attn : XXXX. She assured me they were going to send a new signed lien release out right away. Navy Federal may ask me to authorize them request the new title once they receive the new lien release. I left and went back to work ( see attached letter ). Yesterday XX/XX/XXXX I receive a letter from the collateral Control dept at Navy Federal stating my loan no longer qualifies for a collateral loan and has been converted to an unsecured loan with an increased interest rate of over 11 % more than our current auto loan at 3.99 %. This new rate increased my payment by more than {$100.00} which at this point I have incurred financial damages and want someone held accountable. This is unacceptable business practice. I immediately called Navy Federal and requested an escalation to a manager to fix this. They advised me they would have to call me back within 24 hours and that they have put in a request to hold the account, but I may still be charged, and they would not refund me any excess monies. This request can take 3-5 days to process. At this time, they were made aware my next move would be to put in a formal complaint to the CFPB. The next business day XX/XX/XXXX I receive a voicemail from Navy Federal, but my phone does not ring. They leave a message dont say their name or reason for the call. They provided me a generic callback number of XXXX. I call right away and get the customer service rep on the phone verify who I am, she says she sees who called me and why, but would not give me her direct number or name and put me on hold to see if she could get her on the line. After two attempts she comes back saying the lady is not available and put in a escalation request to have her call me right back. I should get a call back in about 30 minutes to 1 hour. This was at XXXX the time is not XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I still have not received a returned phone call. I called XXXXXXXX XXXX request to speak with a manager in their titling dept and explained the reason for my call. Was transferred XXXX who advised me they sent a second copy of the lien release ( signed ) on XX/XX/XXXX to Navy Federal the address they requested to the Attention of XXXX. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX advised me she could send another copy overnight certified with tracking needing a signature if I could tell her a physical address for Navy Federal and a persons name to make it attention to. This information I do not have. I have requested XXXX XXXX send the copy to my address, however Im not sure they will do that. I advised them I would take the release up to Navy Federal Branch in XXXX XXXX myself and handle this. I would appreciate your prompt resolution of this matter.',\n",

It has been nothing short of a nightmare. Here are the details. \\n\\nLoan approved through XXXX  XXXX XXXX Sent ALL requested paperwork to XXXX  XXXX XXXX including : Lessees Odomotor Disclosure Statement Lessee/Purchaser Acknowledgement and the Disclaimer of Warranties Authorization for Payoff and Title Processing Cashiers check to cover down payment and taxes Numerous phone calls have been originated by me to both XXXX  XXXX XXXX and Lexus on the following dates in an attempt to resolve : Lexus : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX, ( XXXX, XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX  XXXX  XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX, ( XXXX ) XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  ), XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) ;  XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ), XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, there was a three way call between Lexus, XXXX and me the required documents were faxed twice by XXXX  XXXX XXXX and mailed regular mail by XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Lexus and spoke to XXXX who informed me that they had not received any of the documents and in fact, had sent the two checks payable to XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amounts of {$22000.00} ( Consumer Credit Check ) and {$6100.00} ( Cashiers Check ). \\n\\nI was further informed by XXXX at Lexus that I should void said checks and resend from my personal funds in the amount totaling {$28000.00} and include the documents that have been line itemed above. Oddly, Lexus faxed me the documents that they claim were not received in time. \\n\\nSince this did not sound accurate to me, I once again called XXXX  XXXX XXXX to see if I could resolve. \\n\\nImmediately after hanging up with Lexus, I reached back to XXXX  XXXX XXXX Auto Loan Department. After a 45 minute wait, numerous discussions wit XXXX ( who was also attempting to find the right person/department ) I was put back in touch with XXXX, a manager of the department who Id spoken with on XX/XX/XXXX as referenced above. \\n\\nI explained the situation, XXXX referred to the prior months worth of notes and asked me to provide this detailed account of my issue. \\n\\nAt this point, she is as exasperated as I am. I have two checks, a bunch of documents and no answers. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX -XXXX  who referred me back to XXXX who referred me to XXXX who referred me back to original loan officer XXXX XXXX . I left a message for XXXX. Note still unresolved On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alert that Lexus was reporting me for unpaid lease invoices fir 3 months! \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , re-explained everything again. She didnt know how to handle and was submitting an escalation request to funding dept. she said I would hear from someone in 2-3 business days. As of today, I have heard from no one from XXXX  XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, Lexus Financial called. XXXX wanted to know where the documents were. He reported to me that Lexus notated account that no documents had been received. And furthermore, they would not address the erroneous mark on my credit until this matter was resolved. \\n\\nI re-explained the history. He put me in hold and When he came back on the line informed me that Lexus had the documents. I should send the checks to Lexus and provided me wirh a mailing address. \\n\\nNow, the next problem is that the amounts to Lexus are not correct. Money is due back to me from XXXX XXXX XXXX since Ive been paying installment loan since XXXX. \\n\\nI have to request reimbursement back from XXXX  XXXX XXXX Can someone please expedite this to someone who can help me resolve this issue? \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX',\n",

The offer was an incentive of {$2000.00} to transfer my account to another division for management and that while I would only incur interest on the {$2000.00} only. I asked upside down and backwards that this transfer would not incur any additional interest over the course of 3 days. Every single time I was told that it would be a transfer only, that it would not have any effect on my credit report and that I would only continue paying on principal ; my payment of $ XXXX/mo went up.\\n\\nYesterday I find out that I had actually re-financed my loan and agreed to paying an additional {$11000.00} in interest. There is no sane person on EARTH that would agree to paying double interest on a loan?? Unless it was buried in the contract ... .and lied to horrifically and repeatedly.\\n\\nWestlake destroyed my entire credit history ; reporting that I owe two loans to them for a total amount of {$33000.00}. Within their process they have deleted my entire credit history, showing my old account as closed, which should be paid off if this was actually a re-finance correct? They can\\'t seem to see the problem on their end ( further instance of fraud )? \\n\\nMy last conversation with Westlake I requested a transcript of my conversations with them in association to this transaction and was told it would only be released for legal reasons. I explained that it was for legal purposes and was told they would not release it. I got them to admit on tape that they were denying me access to my account information and contact history. \\n\\nApparently this \\'transfer \\' company has a different name yet appears to be operating under the Westlake banner. That said, this certainly points to fraud- why would I have two accounts unless ... ..I do... and that would explain a lot. One is real and one is fraud. doubling the interest charged through lies, deception and manipulation. Informatively, in my reporting them to the XXXX  I found multiple complaints of the exact same circumstance of being ticked into re-financing a loan.\\n\\nI have reached out 3 times to the CEO via email since last month with no response. He did direct his Compliance Officer to respond to my initial email and I was treated like a child, talked down to and incredulousness that I had any concerns whatsoever. He basically said ; it\\'s your fault and live with it. \\n\\nI appreciate you taking the time to review this information and I hope you an find out what is going on- thank you, XXXX',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"Hello, I'm trying to get in touch with someone on a corporate level about the XXXX XXXX dealership located at XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. I originally financed a pre-owned XXXX XXXX XXXX which I was told had just been traded in earlier that day. The XXXX experienced a pre-mature timing chain problem which corporate worked out a resolution with for me. Shortly after, the turbo went out and I was told there was engine damage and the dealership told me it wasn't worth repairing and to trade it in for a new XXXX XXXX ( XXXX model at the time ). I strongly believe the dealership did not fully inspect the XXXX before selling it to me because they wanted a quick sale. As a result, I have been paying off the loan through XXXX for a lemon vehicle that I only got around XXXX miles of use out of for a $ XXXX vehicle and a {$4000.00} down payment. I feel completely robbed as a result of this transaction when I was seeking an economy vehicle as a working student. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe XXXX experience aside, I was told that the trade-in for the XXXX XXXX could be refinanced in one year to lower the payments. I am currently paying {$530.00} a month and am a full-time working student whose job requires a working vehicle. I felt I had no choice but to trade-in because the service center told me the XXXX was not worth fixing as the costs would exceed the value. \\n\\n\\nSeveral unethical issues are apparent at this dealership besides the initial sale of the XXXX. Firstly, the XXXX XXXX had a recall that I immediately scheduled an appointment for upon receiving the notification. The dealership gave me back the vehicle without a working radio and the steering wheel buttons were entirely unusable. I immediately contacted them to resolve the issue and was told that they needed to order a new part. This was in XXXX of this year. I brought the XXXX in to the dealership over four times and called over 10 times over the course of seven months -- each time the service center claimed they had the part and upon dropping the vehicle off, they didn't have it and sent me home. I took that time off from work and wasted countless hours waiting for the problem to be resolved based on false information from the service center. I strongly believe the dealership continuously forgot to order the part throughout that seven month time frame and instead of admitting it, wasted my time as a customer. The final time I took it in they told me they needed to keep it for a few days because they had to order the part ( again ). The problem is finally resolved, after seven-eight months, however this simple recall has cost me a substantial amount of income due to being told to bring it in and them not having the part, telling me they need to  order it still and waiting at the dealership. \\n\\n\\nSecondly, when I initially bought the XXXX  I was told that I receive free oil changes for life at this location. The service advisors claim there is no record of this. This was unethical and a blatant lie from the sale 's associates to get a sale. The service advisors also offered me a discount towards my next service if I took a survey and answered all of the questions according to a screenshot they texted me that had the answers all filled in in the multiple choice bubbles. I did not take the survey as sending a customer correct answers to boost their rating is unethical. \\n\\n\\nFinally, I went back to the dealership the other week after a sale 's associate called me ( I didn't contact them first ) and said that he could refinance the car to get me a lower interest rate. Instead, they tried to get me to trade-in, again, after claiming they couldn't refinance after all. I spent five hours at the dealership just to deal with more  roundabouts from XXXX XXXX and unethical business practices. After I declined trading in I was told by the finance manager that I could take out a Nissan credit card to pay off a projected {$7000.00}  to make it possible to refinance the XXXX XXXX  or voluntarily surrender it to the dealership and take out a new loan on a new XXXX XXXX. Again -- I went in to refinance as I was told when I had first bought the vehicle I would be able to do in one years time. Due to them reaching out first, I assumed they were following up with that promise.\\n\\nI know this has been a long email and a lot to take in. I'm a working student who lives on less than {$30000.00} per year and came in to this dealership for a working vehicle. I have lost countless days of work, time, and dealt with false information and unethical  recommendations after they sold me a lemon, refused to take any sort of accountability, continue to hold me accountable to that negative equity ( I'm paying off a car that I couldn't use still to this day ), and  continued to waste my time with the recall for the XXXX and false refinancing promises. One of the associates claimed he wouldn't make  any money on me trading my XXXX XXXX for a different model and that it would only count as a sale for the store because it was going bankrupt. I don't understand why a business would even tell a customer that. \\n\\n\\nPlease look at my loan history and see how much I have paid your company for ONE working economy vehicle. I have already paid that, and then some and yet I'm stuck with ridiculously high payments on a car I was coerced into getting while paying off the loan for a lemon they sold me. I urge XXXX corporate to be accountable on behalf of their XXXX location and work out a fair loan renegotiation with me based on everything I have endured as a result of this unethical location. I have been accountable as a customer ; it's their turn.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/XXXX My grandmother XXXX XXXX in XXXX California from a XXXX. Around the same time her husband, my grandfather was struggling to recover from XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I drove from XXXX MI, where I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, r to XXXX California due to the double family emergency. My XXXX pay for my auto loan with Chase Auto Finance was due XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI was not able to attend to the financial matter wit Chase Auto Finance until XX/XX/XXXX, once my grandmother was XXXX and my grandfather had been released from the hospital to return home. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase Auto finance requesting a temporary cessation in payments due to the double family emergency. The customer service representative stated that an easier alternative to the temporary cessation would be to agree to a \" Promise to pay \\'\\' byXX/XX/XXXX. I informed him that I would like to use the cessation in payments since I did not know the exact date off-hand in XX/XX/XXXX that my next stipend check or payroll payment as a XXXX would be issued. I offered to provide the gentlemen a copy of my tax transcripts for the past four ( 4 ) years, a copy of my contract with my university regarding funding for the duration that I remain a XXXX student, a copy of the program from my grandmother \\'s XXXX, and a sworn affidavit to that effect. \\n\\nThe customer service representative then asked me if all of that was going on how it was that I was able to afford to pay ALL my mother bills. I explained again that I \\'m a XXXX XXXX XXXX AND XXXX. He stated that he \\'d never heard of the term before and that he \\'d never heard of different payment dates as a XXXX and a XXXX XXXX. He then stated he would not be able to approve the payment extension himself because he did not want to be \" personally responsible if/when after the payment extension I would n\\'t be able to pay my bill. \\'\\' He entered the explanation as such and then handed it off to a supervisor for approval. He told me to call back around the XX/XX/XXXX to check the status of my request. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called back and received the news that the extension had been denied, and the reason was verbatim the explanation that was given by the customer service representative on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked to speak with a supervisor regarding the explanation and the conclusion that I did not have the ability to pay my auto loan. I spoke with a supervisor named XXXX that identified herself with the ID number XXXX. She explained verbatim the reason for the denial. I explained to her that I needed clarification on the reason for the denial -- she refused to provide one, except to explain that it was for the exact same reason that the gentlemen on the XX/XX/XXXX did n\\'t want to extend the payment. She stated that it was the position of Chase Auto Finance that my present situation is not temporary and therefore there was no reason to believe that I would be able to continue making payments on my vehicle. \\n\\nI asked for an written explanation for the denial of payment extension. XXXX refused to provide one stating that because the terms of my original loan had not been modified, no written correspondence would be provided. The lady concluded the conversation by reminding me that because I had not yet paid the payment on the account that even if I walked into a local branch that was open and paid in cash on the XXXX day past-due, that they would report my payment as being thirty ( 30 ) days past-due. This sort of comment seems entirely putative in nature. \\n\\nA renegotiation, or request for modification of loan terms is based upon a financial assessment, and would seemingly constitute a financial evaluation akin to a credit inquiry, taking into account payment history, credit score, and other internal and external factors. However, Chase Auto Finance has refused to provide ANY written explanation and has made it very clear that they will to be providing one. This seems contrary to the practices I \\'ve observed with other banking institutions as the others I deal with prefer all business correspondence to be in writing. \\n\\n\\nNow, the sheer reasoning for the denial is unsound and questionable, as I \\'ve paid on the auto loan for the past five and a half years, dropping the loan amount from the origination amount of just over 21 thousand dollars to just over 2500 dollars. That is, through total compensation over the loan term, I \\'ve paid off 9/10 of the loan. Therefore there is no reason to believe that with a prior income before returning to school of well into six-figures, and with total compensation as a XXXX XXXX and XXXX at or near six-figures, evidenced through the contractual documents, tax transcripts, and payroll information I offered, that there should be any issue. \\n\\nBased upon the first representative \\'s comments in the computer system and conversation on XX/XX/XXXX, it would therefore appear that Chase Auto Finance is scheming, hedging on the fact that I can not make future payments on the vehicle, since to repossess the vehicle and resell it because its resale value is higher than what is currently owed on the vehicle. \\n\\nTo conclude, I had dual family emergencies that has prevented me from pay my bill on-time. I explained this to chase and requested a payment extension. The first Chase representative was willing to extend a promise-to-pay for XX/XX/XXXX, until he understood that I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX. He explained to me that he \\'d never heard of a XXXX XXXX XXXX before, and stated he did n\\'t want to extend or modify the loan repayment schedule because he believed that I did n\\'t have the ability to pay ANY of my current debt obligations. He annotated this information and his viewpoint and subsequently sent it to \" management \\'\\' for approval. \\n\\nChase \" management \\'\\' subsequently conducted a financial evaluation to process my loan modification request for a one-month cessation in payments to allow me to return to MI. Chase \" management \\'\\' concluded that I did n\\'t have the ability to pay ANY of my financial obligations. The supervisor I subsequently spoke with named XXXX with ID XXXX refused to provide any written explanation for the denial and repeated the assertion that I did not have the ability to pay the auto loan, or ANY of my obligations, despite of copious amounts of documentation I was willing to provide that suggested this was not the case, to include tax transcripts, pay schedule for stipend AND employee payroll, prior employee payroll and income documents, and contractual documents regarding funding for me as a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nChase seems to be unwilling to provide temporary relief for customers who lost relatives and are trying to keep accounts current while dealing with the loss, customers who previously demonstrated ability to pay that offer supporting documentation, and customers who have a payment history of paying down a loans with them. It would appear as well that Chase Auto Finance is scheming, hedging on the fact that I can not make future payments on the vehicle to repossess the vehicle and resell it because its resale value is higher than what is currently owed on the vehicle.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"Earlier this year before Covid I had an issue with my XXXX XXXX XXXX  which required me to take it into the shop to have some warranty work completed on it. It was covered after going through some hoops which I get it warranty work no one gets paid for it directly. My issue upon this situation was that the part that had to be ordered came from DriveTime and/or XXXX home office located in AZ. I was told it was remanufactured or like new. Wasn't able to see and verify parts after replacement because they had to be sent back to AZ. Under my warranty contract with them and XXXX XXXX it does state thats in line with the parts they can replace on any vehicle per the agreement. My issue was I was out of vehicle for almost a week because of the time it took for parts to come in and upon asking for a loaner vehicle said the billable hours didn't meet their requirement of reimbursement and I could get loaner any try to get it back but no a promise for reimbursement. Asked on several occasions that I wanted proof of what parts had been replaced and was told by all of them that it is something they have to prove to me per the contract. Fast Forward my needs have changed and am currently looking at getting out of this vehicle and getting into something that better reflects what I need at this time. No dealership will take the trade because of the high interest rate and more money down needed to make the deal happen. I get that but Drivetime/XXXX won't take the trade in as well at all regardless of money I need to put down. I was told they don't take their cars back on trade and/or refinance current loans even if they still make more money on new one. I am tired of the pure bad business practices these companies are allowed to get away with. My previous vehicle I had gotten from them had to be bought back from me after many battles that I eventually proved was a flood damaged vehicle. They couldn't give me the money I had paid into that vehicle being a XXXX XXXX XXXX because I had paid for time I used it and was only given my original down payment. These companies being able to do all of this and the consumer just out of luck? I had also asked what had come of the vehicle bought back from me did they sell it to another sucker. I have filed complaints after complaints but they are still in business doing same shady used car sales. There was now ay my 1st car should have been sold to me let alone past State Inspection. I am filing a class action lawsuit against DriveTIme and/or XXXX for unfair Business Sale tactics and Fraud any help would be appreciated.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'I work for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and have been working diligently to help our member, XXXX XXXX pay off XXXX XXXX XXXX for his XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX vehicle was recovered on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX, their office is located in XXXX, NC. This was due to failure to provide proof of full coverage insurance. The vehicle had full coverage, but XXXX states they did not have record of it. XXXX phone was stolen in the months preceding this incident, so they were unable to contact him by phone and he has not received any notification by mail regarding the problem. The recovering agent advised that he had the opportunity to seize the collateral on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, but he waited to do so until the weekend. This resulted in XXXX XXXX not being able to take any action until two days later when the office was opened, and likely accruing storage fees during this time. Had the agent recovered on Monday when he stated he was to pick up, XXXX could have handled the situation same day with no delay or accrued fees. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX offered to pay XXXX XXXX XXXX in full in order to release collateral to our member. They were advised of severity of him being without transportation and that all we needed was the amount of payoff, as well as recovery expenses to be paid before they would release it. XXXX began calling the office on Monday at XXXX. He gave oral and written authorization for XXXX to speak with XXXX, and we have been more than compliant in every request they have made. Their office has been extremely negligent and disrespectful in trying to resolve, including hanging up on me when calling for follow-up information. I have provided every document they have requested via fax, email, and by phone. The manager, XXXX XXXX, has screened my calls on multiple occasions and has refused to be compliant despite our efforts. XXXX signed an authorization to release information to us, as well as a notarized POA, along with his DL photo, proof of insurance showing XXXX as lienholder with the lienholder address they provided to him. This business uses predatory lending to take advantage of customers who arent aware how badly they are being taken advantage of, and they have basically refused to accept payment for the balance of loan. They are not reporting to credit bureaus and continue to charge fees along with unfair interest rates that are unfair and deceptive, I am sure it is a subprime loan. There has been no evidence of good-faith business practices here, nothing short of illegal, theyve been immoral and unethical to say the least. I have requested an itemized statement as to what is owed to verify that there has not been evidence of loan churning and they have refused. Every time a document has been requested, we have complied, and then they give a different request to comply with, which again, we provided as requested. After escalating from the local branch to Customer Relations Coordinator, I received noticed that they were waiting on another bill from the towing company before they could give me the total amount owed. The tow company had already advised they had sent the bill to the office. They provided me with an additional copy nevertheless that I forwarded to XXXX. However the local office advised they could not provide payoff today, but had to wait until following day to do so. There is three hours of driving time needed for him to go to their office in XXXX and the storage facility in XXXX. Hes already made arrangements with his employer to take time off every day trying to resolve this, putting him in a tough position with employer as well. As a lender and consumer alike, I have been more than offended by the practice with this office.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"In XX/XX/2018 my Lease expired on the XXXX XXXX which was through XXXX. At this time I rolled it over into a purchase also with XXXX. At the same time I had a XXXX XXXX but didn't know. During my lease with XXXX I was on automatic payments through their website and payment were made in a timely fashion. I wanted to continue that payment arrangement. I tried to do that but for the first few months they couldn't get the system to function properly. Every time I would call to seek resolution I would end up repeating the same story and couldn't get to anyone to effect change nor could I get a ticket on the problem to reference or a case manager to handle the complaint. After months of the non resolution I stopped making payments and told XXXX I wanted to make payments the way I had for years but didn't want to pay by phone or by check that wasn't convenient. I did this in hopes that it would escalate the issue to someone that could effect change and fix the issue. After every contact with XXXX I told them ( the conversation was recorded ) that I would pay the amount due in full the minute I could pay electronically as I had in the past. My thought was if I continued to pay by mail or phone they would never fix the issue considering it had been months with no resolution. Perhaps non payment would get someone's attention. There are over ten recordings of me saying I would pay immediately if the web based product would function just as it had in the past. In XXXX they repossessed the car and send me a demand letter. Once again I said I would pay the amount due but only by their product that the other 99 % of their customers have access to and enjoy. At this point I felt discriminated against because I didn't have access to the same functions as other customers. I later got the NC AG involved and they wrote a letter on my behalf and agreed with me and we are now in a stalemate. Also XXXX falsified a insurance claim on this car while in their possession as it must have had some damage to it as the Insurance company called to follow up on the claim. This is now effecting my ability to purchase a home and want to access all free services before paying an attorney. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\",\n",

XXXX told me they do not give statements. So I explain to her I need a monthly account breakdown each month showing interest and other charges I am being charged each month in order for me to pay my car note each month and a balance break down in black and white on their website or paper statement, but this is important if they are servicing my loan. They must bill me fairly and show what they are billing me in black and white. Or they will give me no choice but to also contact the State Attorney Office also for assistance.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'My Santander auto loan should be part of the class action lawsuit. We took action the summer of XXXX through XXXX XXXX courts to put a hold on all transactions and action until a hearing was taken. At that time we were unaware of the lawsuit. Covid hit and we had no hearing set, but found out about the lawsuit. I feel we were overlooked because we put the hold in the court thinking that we were doing the right thing. They say our loan should not be part, but I feel that I have proof of unfair and predatory lending and fit into the subprime practices of the company. The loan originated on XX/XX/XXXX and falls into the actions by us being taken before XX/XX/XXXX. The company violated the fair lending requirements of the ECOA ( Regulation B ). Proof of that should be the 3 copies that I have from the Automobile sales company of them restructuring this subprime auto loan. I have sent a letter to my Attorney Generals office and was directed on XX/XX/XXXX to call Santander, whom I have had no contact with due to the court advising me onto do so. Santander was harassing me with phone calls even after the court order was on file. I have All dates in my phone. It is starting again due to we tried to have a lawyer take this action and he wasnt following through. I called XXXX XXXX who also directed me to Santander. I then called Santander on XX/XX/XXXX spoke to XXXX # XXXX who said that he had nothing saying that my loan was eligible. I asked who could evaluate my loan and he only offered to settle ; even after Santander illegally took the vehicle while the petition was in court. I then called CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX to be sure I should put in this complaint. There is not a loan number on my contract.',\n",

Loan was approved XX/XX/XXXX. Subsequent documents were signed on this day. NUMEROUS calls were made to the initial loan officer from both our business number and cell numbers regarding updates concerning the vehicles titling & registration concerns. \\n\\nLoans were transferred/refinanced to this XXXX, Wyoming Branch from a credit union in the state of Alaska so a new title and registration needed to be issued. As of todays date XX/XX/XXXX we have yet to receive title transfer information on this vehicle. We are currently paying on the loan as of XX/XX/XXXX and the bank has not provided us with new titling documents to update the state in which it should be registered. Tags and plates have not been issued and we have been asked by the local police department to obtain current tags and license plates for the vehicle with Alaska plates. A police officer documented this on XX/XX/XXXX. After receiving the warning on the ticket issued by the officer we again contacted the bank and requested to speak in person to the branch manager. The branch manager assured us the paperwork would be handled in a timely manner and that the loan officer who initiated our loan was no longer with their branch.\\n\\nThe larger of the loans is an additional commercial vehicle thats Wyoming tags were set to expire on XX/XX/XXXX and we voiced our concerns with the loan officer that the loan be processed in a timely manner. Unfortantely as of todays date XX/XX/XXXX the vehicle has been out of service because of expired tags since that date with no update on the titling and registration with the state of Wyoming. We were told the process to update the information with the state of Wyoming would take up to 10 days. It has now reached 45 days. This vehicle is a work vehicle and has now been out of service because of expired tags since XX/XX/XXXX. Commercial Insurance costs have been paid on this vehicle for our business use and we have been unable to operate our company with it.\\n\\nWe have Now been paying on a loan since XX/XX/XXXX thats paperwork was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX on a vehicle that can not be driven because of expired tags and on a vehicle with out of state tags that are now ticket worthy according to the state of Wyoming Police Department. \\nWe have sent emails to this U.S Bank branch that have gone unanswered and have made several calls and left messages that have not been returned.\\n\\nThe only updated response we have gotten has from the branch manager regarding any updates stated ; BRANCH MANAGERS EMAIL sent XX/XX/XXXX ; Attached is the POA that would be required for both vehicles. This is in order to finish processing the titles since technically the business owns the vehicles. I would need two ( 2 ) original copies signed and notarized for both vehicles.\\n\\nThis Power of Attorney was taken to and reviewed by our business attorney. We were told by both the bank and our attorney that is was for the purpose of the bank titling and registering the vehicle for us. \\n\\nOUR RESPONSE ; After waiting over 45 minutes at the local branch and being told the branch manager was expected to arrive and never showed we emailed the following ; We dropped the notarized release form for the titling/registration of the XXXX this morning. Placed them on the seat at your desk. Can you email to confirm that you received rhem. Thanks! \\n\\nBRANCH MANAGERS RESPONSE ; Yes I did get those, thank you! I have them going down to get processed tonight ... It does take our back office up to 10 business days. I will keep my ear to the ground and let you know when everything has been taken care of so you can get the cars registered. \\n\\nWE RESPONDED ; Wasn't the purpose of signing the power of attorney to have you as the bank register the vehicles? Wasnt that the whole point of signing the power of attorney?\\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX The email has gone unanswered.\\n\\nNumerous attempts to resolve this issue including several calls, numerous visits in person and emails that have gone unanswered has resulted in us filing a complaint as we have a right to proper and timely lending practices. The proper paperwork to legalize the use of these vehicles in the state of Wyoming after finalizing a loan on XX/XX/XXXX should be expedited by US Bank and their associates.\",\n",

When I brought this to Wells Fargo attention they had no idea what happened, I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to alert them of the situation. I called them again on the XXXX to discuss the situation further and to see the actions that would be taken to correct the issue. The escalation department followed up with me on XX/XX/XXXX telling me what happened and that situation would be corrected, the second loan would be deleted and that they had received the payoff check from my credit union where I had already refinanced the car on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative also spoke to the loan officer at my credit union advising that every thing was taken care of and the money would be applied and corrected to the first loan and the loan for the car was released to the credit union. On XX/XX/XXXX I discovered that the loan for the car had been paid off with my credit union and Wells Fargo are the ones who paid it off. When I called Wells Fargo they advised that I had not paid off the account and that the loan was still open and active with them and that it needed to be paid. I advised that I had spoken to someone in their escalations department and they advised everything thing they had taken care of. They advised that they were not sure why but the check was reissued. On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by the escalations department again and they advised that they wanted to speak to someone at my credit union and tried her best to advise why the check was sent back and see if the credit union would reissue the check to them. Luckily my credit union was ok with not checking my credit again since it has dropped from the amount of checks it has had recently. Wells Fargo advised they would be issuing a credit correction for me but when I asked on the XXXX I was advised that it also hadn't been completed yet. I was advised on XX/XX/XXXX that the credit correction would be done and still nothing yet.\",\n",

Even though XXXX XXXX JUST told her that a refund was owed, so I\\'m not sure how almost 4 weeks later that isn\\'t \" notification \\'\\'. The rep told my wife that it could be up to another 4 weeks! \\n\\nMy wife also asked about the issue of the incorrect address. The rep said that she would add a note to the file but couldn\\'t guarantee it would be sent to the correct address. The old address is no longer forwarding my mail so if the check is sent there it will be as good as gone! \\n\\nMy wife asked if the funds could be directly deposited to my bank account and the rep never really answered her question and just brushed her off and talked about the mailing date. \\n\\nIn the current days of massive job layoffs and covid-related expenses, this {$640.00} would go a long way in helping my family. However, after holding on to it for a YEAR after it should have been return, it seems Bridgecrest is in no hurry to send it to me.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"I ask that you please give me the chance to provide documentation to verify my statements to follow. This is probably a long shot ... I recently discovered the Reaffirmation Agreement Santander Bank Lawyers & I negotiated prior to my Bankruptcy Discharge in XXXX added an additional 2 yrs. to my Chrysler Capital car loan. My car payments have always been paid on time, even w/challenges encountered to pay {$490.00} mo. payment w/o access prior to discharge. Santander & I clearly discussed following terms : To lower my interest rate from 10.9 % to 7 % & recalculate payment to reflect 7 %. Since new payment of {$390.00} was over {$100.00} less than original loan, I trusted & understood loan was recalculated at 7 %. Instead, Santander created the Agreement w/intent to cause me financial harm & their company gain from my losses. Loan supposed to end XXXX XXXX along w/GAP Insurance. However, the purposeful intent to create this legal document ( Agreement ) & intentionally OMIT the loan extension of an additional 2 yrs., I will be w/o GAP Insurance & literally pay an additional {$9400.00} plus on top of the initial loan cost of over {$26000.00}! I now expect to be in serious financial distress as a result of Santander gaining my trust & never to expected they would cause me such harm for monetary gain for their company. My plan was to retire 6 mo. after my car loan ended in XXXX XXXX. I have worked for the XXXX since XXXX as a XXXX, currently for the XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I am very unsure of my future as a result of their intentional financial abuse. Again, my car payment history is outstanding despite the XXXX Bankruptcy filing. I hope this type of abuse is placed in the Bankruptcy Abuse Protection Act. I know I must sound like an XXXX to have this happen to me. I just don't understand why I am unable to obtain assistance. Yes, we both signed the Reaffirmation Agreement. This document is false yet it was filed in the NJ Bankruptcy Court in XXXX, NJ. Thank you for your time.\",\n",

I knew my credit score was weak because I just did my annual free credit report.i found the truck and wanted to make a deal. I then was told that no finance company would do a contract due to the miles and that I needed to look for a more higher price vehicle to guarantee financing.So I was pointed to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.which had a sticker price marked at {$18000.00} on the window the basic model car I then went ahead and just told them to pre screen me to see if I qualify for a loan on the car, I didn't even test drive the car because I didn't think I would be able to afford it.so while in the office I mentioned to the dealership manager that my sister was a employee at their dealership and he assured me that I would be taken care of.ok while the contract was being drawn up the manager walks in the salesmans office and says by the way I'm throwing in a service contract for your car it's really good and it will help your deal go through because finance company 's like that your protecting your investment I mentioned to him it's a new car doesn't it have a factory warranty? His response was I needed it to assure me the loan and I can remove after 6 months.I honestly felt I can trust him being that I have family working there.So then he comes with my credit report and asks me if I was in jail for like 10 years or something why I did not have any sign of revolving credit or bank account or credit cards? I told him I had a car reposessd in XX/XX/XXXX and that it just depressed me and would never let it happen again so I was just cash on hand.he mentioned that no bank would give me a interest at 3 % which is what I asked for I had a lack of credit history total debt was {$1100.00} how a 13.9 % interest rate on my final contract and i was told only chrysler capital was the only one who could finance me was odd. 6 months go by I remove service contract, and I am devastated when I hear XXXX is stopping production on the XXXX.I saw a msrp in XX/XX/XXXX of {$21000.00} fall to {$13000.00} with factory rebates on the same purchase I just made 6 months prior.I can't refinance car because I owe {$16000.00} on a car that was financed at 13.9 % all my payments of $ XXXXmore the 3/4 going towards interest I know cars lose value but this is like a robbery on paper I wrote dealership various letters with no response.all I ask is a fair deal, I like the car.i paint cars for a living and I did some awesome upgrades to the car I want the dealership to rewrite the deal at a lower interest rate without the service contract so it doesn't inflate the price from when I bought the car with the {$1000.00} down I put on it and I don't think it's fair to be mislead into buying a car because of the price keep in mind I walked in looking for a truck.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'Letter to WF dated XX/XX/XXXX : I am writing to finalize and complain about the harassment that I have had with WF in regard to this loan. This will be my last attempt to settle this debt ( inappropriately processed ), related to my XXXX home construction loan that I obtained from WF. I am a victim of misleading and false statements and promises made by your representative during the fiasco of my construction loan. Also, I have attempted to previously discuss this loan with WF. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, at XXXX, I left a voice message with XXXX at XXXX and havent received a return call. It is aggravating to have to present over and over the timeline of what was one of the worst times in my life. \\nIn late XXXX, my husband and I, sought to build our dream home in XXXX, OR. We were approved a home construction loan through the XXXX WF office. We began construction and during the process our general contractor, XXXX XXXX, bailed on the entire project leaving it unfinished and us holding the bag. He was not sufficiently vetted or screened by your Real Estate Construction Loan Department and other construction related insurances that would assure that construction would be completed. In fact, he withdrew funds from the WF escrow construction funds and failed to use these funds to build our home. He filed for bankruptcy and had all debts discharged including our {$67000.00} judgment against him. We were only able to collect {$10000.00} from the performance bond ( XXXX on the dollar ). \\nInstead of admitting that there were errors and mistakes made by WF, we were told that we must use whatever methods and loans available to us to complete the home. Therefore, we accepted three WF loans. We had the construction loan that would allow no more draws : {$23000.00} signature loan, a WF Visa in the amount of {$10000.00} and WF auto loan that financed my XXXX truck at 129 % of its value and the same loan of which this letter refers to. These new loans plus another of my credit card financed the completion of the house. The WF loan officer promised that once the home was completed, we could refinance into permanent financing to pay off the {$23000.00} promissory note, the {$10000.00} Visa and our truck loan. \\nDue to these unlawful actions of WF, I am claimant of the {$140.00} XXXX class action settlement related to the opening of unauthorized accounts. \\nAfter the home was finally complete, WF refused to refinance the mortgage to incorporate the promissory note of {$23000.00}, the Visa of {$10000.00}, and this auto loan. We were forced to apply to modify the real estate portion of the loan. After WF misplaced ( or never received ) the loan modification package three times, I withdrew {$3800.00} from my retirement to retain an attorney to work through this complicated process. However, during this time WF started foreclosure proceedings. Consequently, we put our home up for sale as a short sale and sold it in XX/XX/XXXX, but continued to battle with WF on the outstanding balances from the Visa and promissory note and this auto loan. \\nI am very tired of dealing and cleaning up all the messes that in fact, WF created. I have been given relief through Court action on one loan with WF being forced to excuse this debt. \\nNow that the auto loan is over 10 years old and the result of WF inappropriate practices, I want WF to release the title to my 2005 XXXX XXXX. Do the right thing finally!',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'In XX/XX/XXXX, I opened an auto loan with Zions Bank for the amount of {$25000.00}. On the original promissory note, it stated that my monthly payments would be {$480.00}. I faithfully paid {$480.00} each month with the exception of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. For those two months, I paid {$100.00} for a payment deferment per Zions Bank \\'s policy. \\n\\nThe apparent problem with the loan began in XX/XX/XXXX. For some reason that Zions Bank has yet to explain, I began to receive monthly payment coupons for my loan which stated that I should pay just over {$400.00}, instead of the original promissory note \\'s stated {$480.00}. I naively assumed that Zions Bank knew what they were doing in managing my loan and had perhaps readjusted something with the loan. So, I began to faithfully pay {$410.00} per month. With each successive month \\'s payment coupon, it reflected that I was AHEAD of my payment schedule since I had paid {$410.00} instead of the stated required {$400.00} per month. \\n\\nAfter nearly 36 months of this payment schedule, the last payment coupon I received stated that I only needed to pay around {$100.00} since I was AHEAD from paying a little extra each month. Unfortunately, I ignorantly assumed that Zions Bank was competently managing my loan, and I did not keep the hard copies of my monthly payment coupons. As you may well understand, I was completely blindsided and dumbfounded when this XX/XX/XXXX ( when my loan should have been paid off ), I received a letter from Zions Bank stating that I owed roughly a {$3500.00} balance on my loan immediately or I would be sent to collections! That so-called balance ( Zions claims ) was the equivalent of the past 36 months of paying {$410.00} instead of {$480.00}. I was never notified of any overdue balance or charges during that 36 months, but, as stated earlier, my monthly payment coupons indicated that I was AHEAD of schedule. \\n\\nAfter a couple of weeks of working Zions Bank, trying to get them to send me copies of my monthly payment coupons that explicitly stated that I should pay {$400.00} instead of {$480.00}, Zions has yet to deliver. Instead, they only sent me my payment history ( see attached ). More disturbing is the fact that after talking to someone that represented the Office of the President of Zions Bank and explaining my situation, her best explanation concerning why Zions Bank would have sent me monthly payment coupons requiring {$400.00} instead of the original {$480.00} from the promissory note was simply, \" I \\'m sorry. That must have been a mistake. \\'\\' It certainly was not my mistake, so why am I the XXXXne being penalized? \\n\\nAfter another week of receiving letters and phone calls from Zions Bank demanding that I pay the so-called balance of {$3500.00}, and with no hope in sight of being able to resolve this dilemma ( with Zions Bank accepting no responsibility ), I simply paid the balance by draining my son \\'s savings account. I have felt absolutely used and abused since that day I paid Zions Bank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. \\n\\nI emailed and called the Office of the President for Zions Bank, once again requesting for them to send me copies of the last 12 months of monthly payment coupons so that I could show them what THEY did with managing my loan, hoping that they might acknowledge their obvious mismanagement of my loan and make things right, but they will not accommodated my request.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX  est Called Credit Acceptance regarding struggles with car payment. \\nInquired about options available and what I can do. Representative said I can do a \" Voluntary Surrender \\'\\' Rep. said they pick up the car, sell at auction, $ from sale will go towards my balance. If it pays off my loan then I don\\'t owe them, if the sale does not pay the balance I am responsible for it. I agreed to this option, as there were no other options provided to me by the rep. Furthermore the rep. asked me if the co-owner that is also on the auto loan contract agree with the \" Voluntary Surrender \\'\\' I said yes ( rep. never asked to speak to the co-owner ) Rep. also explained that they will be calling me the following weak to arrange to have the car picked up! \\nI called back a couple of hours later to make sure that the automatic payment was stopped since I was giving back the car. The rep. that answered said no it hadn\\'t been canceled but that she would cancel it. I also asked if it was set in their system for my car to be picked up and she said \" yes \\'\\'. \\nXX/XX/XXXX I went to my car to clean in out but, the car was gone! I proceeded to call Credit Acceptance but they were closed however, there was a recording saying \" if your car has been repossessed and you want to make a payment \\'\\' I now realized that this solution was a very bad solution. Monday was a holiday and they were closed. Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice of seizure and personal property inventory in the mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that they on behalf of credit acceptance they have repossessed my car and should I want any of my possessions I would have to pay a storage fee starting at {$70.00} a day.Immediately I called Credit Acceptance and spoke to 3 different reps. with one of the reps. saying that the very first rep. should have to about other options such as deferment, selling the car, and refinancing. However, nothing was resolved between this phone call and the 3 different reps. \\nI contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX and filed a complaint ID XXXX. I received a response via the USPS mail approximately 7 days later dated XX/XX/XXXX. The letter states that the Rep. explained what voluntary surrender was and that the tow company Summary of facts 1. Credit Acceptance Representative DID NOT explain what is all involved with \" Voluntary Surrendor \\'\\' A. Show \\'s as a repossession B. Loan goes into default C. Negative impact on credit 2. Rep. DID NOT ask to speak to co-owner of vehicle. Rep. asked me if co-owner agrees with the surrender I said yes However, co-owner does not.\\n\\n3. Rep. said that someone will be calling next weak to arrange to pick up car. Car was towed on XX/XX/2018. There were NO MISSED CALLS on my phone nor does my phone call records reflect any incoming calls. Moreover the letter from Credit Acceptance states that the tow company tried to contact me and this is simply not true.\\n\\n4. Unable to retrieve personal items from my vehicle as I do not have the money to do so. \\nI am sending this complaint to you in the hope that this can be resolved in a timely positive manner',\n",

When the new financial institution called they got the payoff on XX/XX/2017 that was good through XX/XX/2017. The check was received by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2017. At the time my ex thought the loan had been completely paid off, since he had  asked for a payoff. When the new financial institution wrote the check to XXXX XXXX, they did not figure in the interest for that gap. I received a call on XX/XX/2017 stating the payment was late and would affect my credit score. A payment of {$300.00} is what was left on the account. I was told it was due on XX/XX/2017. I had previously called in to be sure the loan was in good standing before this, and I was  reassured it was. I have NEVER been late on a payment. When speaking with XXXX XXXX I pleaded with them on what I needed to do for this to not impact my credit score. I was told I would need to have the payment made today, as the reports are not sent until month end. I was told if it was taken care of within that week, I would not see a negative impact. I hung up the phone and called my ex and he made the payment that day. After he called, I called back in to confirm payment was showing in process and paid. I was told on the phone that I did not need to worry about it affecting my credit, that a note would be made on the account and it would be taken care of without a negative impact. They completely lied to me. My credit now shows a late payment when I did exactly what was asked of me and within the same day. I did not stretch it out or let it slide. I wrote XXXX XXXX a letter asking for a one time forgiveness and explained the situation, they would not grant it. The reasons why I was unaware about the loan was I had confirmation from him it had been paid off, which is why I did not realize there was a balance. XXXX XXXX stated that the other financial institution would have to write a letter stating their mess up, even though they know exactly what happened even though the loan was always timely and only with them for a year. I do not even know who the new financial institution is, as I am not on the loan. I would just really appreciate a one time courtesy from them as I was the cosigner and I would've taken care of it sooner had I been made aware. I feel that they waited to be able to penalize me and intentionally drop my credit score. For someone who always pays on time this extremely frustrating.\",\n",

I was originally financed through Regional Acceptance Corporation ( I believe its a sun trust or truist bank now, was originally a BB and T ). I received phone calls from regional Acceptance about me paying bills after I refinanced my truck. I told them that I was no longer financed with them. My old roommate called me a few weeks ago and told me that a repo company was trying to take my truck and I immediately tried to call or get in touch with them about this. I would call, get put on a long hold, and then I would get hung up on. About last week, I finally got in contact with them and thought I straightened everything out. He said that he was sorry for the inconvenience and said that my truck will no longer be repoed. Just about an hour ago, I received another phone call in regards to my truck. They asked me if I had possession of my vehicle still and I said yes. She said that my truck was up for repo and I need to pay the money that I owe to regional Acceptance or it will get towed. I tried to explain the situation once again and then asked to be transferred to a higher up. She said she would and I heard the phone click as she hung up the phone and the line disconnected. I have received phone calls and then the line would disconnect out of nowhere. Im trying to get my bank to help me fix the issue. I can not have my truck towed for no reason because I work at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and Im in XXXX XXXX. If I lose my truck I will be in a very inconvenient situation. If I can get a phone call whenever yall have a chance, I have evidence that shows that regional signed for the check.

I waited for the money to be transferred for about 10 business days and nothing happened. I called Ally Financial and was told the payment was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Why would I get a 10 day payoff amount and schedule it for 4 months later? The person on the phone said I needed to change the date and she would walk me through the process. I kept her on speaker and brought up the account online. When I tried to change the date, the calendar would not change. I had to close the online site and reopen it. And after another few attempts I was able to get the calendar to change. I then asked why the payoff amount was more and I was told there was a XXXX dollar a day charge which added to the balance. This is the most difficult financial group I have ever had to deal with. Why would anyone get a 10 day payoff amount and schedule the payment for XXXX? My experience times a few XXXX more means big money for them.',\n",

So how am I supposed to even know whats going on when they wont comply? I own, operate and pay for ONE vehicle. I have NEVER lived at the address associated with the creditors account -- which states on my credit it was reported by them -- and I am sick of seeing this information on my credit. I dont care how it gets removed it just needs to or they need to be more open about their communication with me. Ive called multiple times with no resolution because theyve simply made it not their problem but what IS a problem is having this under my name and on my credit. And because I dont have the right social security number, there is no information I have been given, which has led me to dispute. Do you all need bank statements, my XXXX file,.?? What is it? I cant even protect myself because Im given no option?! This is literally outrageous and Im very close to suing them. If its mine and certified then why can I make no changes, be removed, get access to the account when I call to start, any of those things?? Is this car parked outside my house? Do I have even a copy of a key? Have I ever driven this vehicle or made any payments on it?? When it makes sense I cant say anything, but this is making ZERO. The answer to every question here is no and Im not standing for that.\\n\\nI dont pay late, in fact I pay early. I dont have ANY other accounts that are suffering, so how is this adding up?',\n",

I noticed that Global Lending Services reported me 60 days past due for the months of XXXX and XXXX on my XXXX credit file. I disputed the late payments with XXXX and provided proof that I paid my monthly obligation. GLS informed XXXX that the information provided was accurate. I called GLS to inquire why they are reporting me late. The company informed me that because the loan term came to an end, it doesn't matter if I am paying them every month because the full amount is due immediately. The account manager informed me that they will continue to report me late ( even if I pay my monthly payment ) and once the account reached 120 days, the account will be listed as a charge off. The remaining loan amount is also non-consistent. On XXXX the remaining amount displays {$4500.00}. On XXXX the remaining amount is {$6200.00}. On XXXX the remaining amount is {$5800.00}. On The Global Lending Services Site the payoff quote is XXXX. The company is reporting inaccurate information on every platform! This is devastating as I have made sure to continue to pay this company even with the high interest rates and overly high late charges that have accumulated on my account. The account manager informed me that I am still financially obligated, but they will report me late until I give them the full amount ( over {$4000.00} ). This is a predatory loan. I am also accruing a daily interest amount of {$2.00}. This is a trap and really has to be illegal. Please assist me!\",\n",

I was awarded a vehicle loan by santander consumer USA, and I chose a XXXX XXXX from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. The way the loan was structured I would be paying 200 % of the vehicles value and after multiple failed attempts and no help from the staff or reps at the company I was forced to file for bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I even called to see if there were any payment options due to my situation being XXXX and me not having a steady income and having medical issues, such as my XXXX breaking down or no assistance ( no nurse ) the company still refused to assist me in any way. Lastly I acquired 2 loan companies who were willing to refinance and take over the loan near a 3 % APR and Santander still refused. The companies offering the new rate were upfront with me and wondered how did I even get the loan because I had no drivers license. The gentlemen suggested I need to look into it and advised me I may have been targeted just to access may income. After great assistance from the law firm that assisted in filing my chapter XXXX bankruptcy due to Santanders ' unfair practices I am picking up the pieces of my financial ruin. Im not completely blaming them however because of their greed and very confusing XXXX financing terms I was put in a position to fold ( for lack of a better word ). The file attached is a financial payment history document I sent to my attorney after Santander reps advised they would no longer work with me and they will deal with my attorney if need be.\",\n",

I signed and returned the documents on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was informed the loan amount would not cover my payoff as interest accrues daily and I needed to make a partial payment, which I paid {$50.00} and sent XXXX XXXX the confirmation of payment. I was informed that my loan went to funding on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and would take XXXX business days for XXXX XXXX XXXX to receive the payoff. By XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was concerned the vehicle was not paid off and I did n't want it to have a negative impact on my credit so I made the full payment to my old lender. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received a voicemail from XXXX XXXX stating they made a mistake on my interest rate and that the interest rate increased to 4.79 % with a financed amount of {$44000.00}. This was followed by an email with new loan documents showing the increased terms along with a request for additional paystubs. XXXX XXXX called again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to make sure I received the new increased loan documents and that I needed to sign them asap in order to get the loan funded. I informed them that I am currently in a disaster area and affected by XXXX XXXX and trying to get documents copied/notarized, etc. was not possible. Furthermore, after almost a month of the refinance process including loan documents signed, I found it suspicious that the interest rate increases after a major disaster occurs in my area.\",\n",

After 6 months of on time payments I was denied the ability to refinance my car loan because the vehicle had over 100,000 miles on it.

Approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I was in an accident with the vehicle and it was totalled. My insurance company, XXXX, paid to Navy Federal 70 % of what the vehicle was worth. The remainder balance was reduced through GAP insurance which I had with Navy. The remaining amount of the loan was approximately {$3000.00}. I took out another loan to get a new car because I have to work. I am making a payment of {$570.00} as a monthly car note, my insurance also went up exponentially because my insurance increased my premium due to the accident and because I moved. I applied to refinance the remaining {$3000.00} with Navy and they denied refinancing my loan. They put my loan in default and a delinquent status, which will impair my credit because they denied refinancing my loan and require me to make the regular payment of {$570.00} as I did prior to totalling my car. This put me in a position to make two full car payments with over {$1000.00} per month going out of my paycheck to car loan payments. I can not afford that. I also rent, furniture bill, electric bills and other bills and I can not afford to pay {$1000.00} to car payments. I informed Navy Federal of this and they still denied refinancing my car loan to get my car payments cheaper. I think this it is unscrupulous and unethical for Navy to put me in a position in which I am unable to make the payments and unreasonably denying my refinancing of the remainder of my previous car loan. This puts me in a position to get bad credit through no fault of my own. I am not unwilling to make the payment, I just can't afford {$570.00} per month and I have informed Navy of this fact. Navy is being unreasonable in denying refinancing of my loan.\",\n",

The payoff has still not posted ; I\\'m chatting with their customer service as I\\'m writing this complaint, and Ally is saying they \" may \\'\\' have rejected the check and mailed it back to me ( I\\'ve been waiting for over an hour while they try to find out for sure ). If they really have mailed the check back to me, my new lender would have to cancel their loan and I would have to reapply if I still want to refinance -- but because I now have that 30 day late payment on my credit report ( which would\\'ve been avoided had they processed the check during the time frame they said they would ), my credit has likely been so adversely impacted that I can no longer get the same interest rate I was promised before. Even if the check HASN\\'T been mailed and they DO end up processing it, this late payment will likely hurt my chances of being approved for a home loan now, like I am planning to do soon. It seems as though Ally keeps intentionally delaying the payoff so they can make a last-ditch effort to keep charging me as much interest as they can before I refinance, which I feel may even be illegal.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'In XXXX of XXXX I financed a car loan through XXXX XXXX  - a division of Santander Consumer USA , Inc. The monthly payment was {$500.00} with the first payment due on XX/XX/XXXX, the term of the loan was 72 months in length and I would make my final payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Over the term of my financing I ran into multiple difficulties in making my monthly installment. I was offered a deferment of the payment ( s ) that I was behind. Over the term of my loan, I deferred a total of XXXX payments. Each time I spoke with a representative of Santander they would advise me that my maturity date would be extended and I would be charged a fee of {$25.00} to defer my payment ( s ) and it would bring my account back to good standing. I would be recorded accepting the payment deferment, it would be reviewed and within a week my account would reflect current. I would not sign any paperwork for the maturity date extension. After my final deferment, my new maturity date was now XX/XX/XXXX. As I approached by maturity date I noticed that I still had an unpaid balance of {$6000.00} and knew it would not payoff by XXXX. I called and spoke with several representative at which point they referred me to their Office of the President for resolution. I tried to understand that if my maturity date for each deferred payment was extended how could I still owe so much? I was told that after any payment deferment my loan would turn into a \" Daily Simple Interest \\'\\' loan if I fell delinquent again. I was never told that or did I sign any paperwork with that understanding. Because I needed my car to go to work, their OOP offered me a loan modification for the remaining balance. The balance I owed was then a new term and maturity to payoff my loan. I continued to try and understand how it was possible for Santander to extend my maturity date and turn my loan into a XXXX loan without my knowledge. I am currently still paying a monthly payment to Santander to payoff this balance. On two occasions I have asked a representative to please provide me a copy of my original loan note so that I can review to see if there is verbiage stating that if I accepted a payment deferment, my loan would be subject to XXXX terms. On both occasions, I received only page 1 of my 3 page note. I would like someone to provide me with how and where I was told about the XXXX factor in their payment deferral process. I felt so much appreciation when Santander offered me help through some very difficult financial times during my loan, but never expected that the additional 8 months of loan payments I made through their deferment program would still have me owing {$6000.00}. I am looking for confirmation that Santander \\'s practice is ethical and within Fed Reg guidelines. I want to ensure that others in my same situation do not accept consumer assistance programs from Santander when the consumer is unaware of the consequences of these programs.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a brand new XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX from car salesman, XXXX XXXX for approximately {$21000.00}. I didnt have established credit and the lender that I got through XXXX XXXX was Santander Consumer. \\n\\nDuring the first part of XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to XXXX XXXX ( still at XXXX XXXX ) to inquire about trading my car for something larger, as I have a wife, XXXX children and a nephew that I am the father figure for, to provide transportation for daily. XXXX stated that he would look into the inventory and trades at XXXX XXXX and get back with me. \\n\\nBetween approximately XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I stopped into XXXX XXXX to ask if there was an update about any vehicles. XXXX told me there was a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( with a sunroof ) that was being repaired and he would get a hold of the body shop doing the work, so that I could go see it. From what XXXX said, the price, body style, and condition of the XXXX sounded great. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received the address of the body shop that had the XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX. I took my mother out with me to see it, but there was no XXXX to be found. We went back to XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX, who again assured my mother and I what a great vehicle this was. ** My mother is XXXX, and my father had a XXXX XXXX  at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX because of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I needed to have a solid vehicle with room for all of my family or all the things my parents would have to take on many trips back to XXXX. ** On XX/XX/XXXX, I texted XXXX XXXX to start working up what XXXX XXXX would give me for a trade. He stated that he would have the paperwork at the dealership for me to pick up on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI arrived at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was promised the XXXX would be there on XX/XX/XXXX I just needed to get my financing and {$1000.00} cash or check for them to hold. I had my mother with me again, and she refused to let them keep {$1000.00} cash. I went to my bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and dealt with Assistant Vice President, XXXX XXXX. She reviewed XXXX XXXX paperwork and found that they had over charged me several XXXX dollars. \\n\\nI texted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX AM that there were paperwork errors from XXXX XXXX that needed to be fixed. I went to XXXX XXXX they agreed there was a mistake and corrected the paperwork. I went back to my bank and received a loan and a {$1000.00} check to hold the XXXX. I took a copy of the unsigned loan and a {$1000.00} check back to XXXX XXXX and completed paperwork for the purchase of the XXXX XXXX XXXX pending I liked the vehicle upon being able to physically examine/drive it. \\n\\nThe XXXX  was not ready to see on XX/XX/XXXX. I had stopped in to see XXXX and he explained that the sunroof was taking a bit of time, it was a new shop for the dealership, ect and promised I could see it on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I took my mother down to see the XXXX at XXXX XXXX. My mother and I were very disappointed. There was no sunroof, there was extensive hail damage to the body, after being detailed there were really bad stains and my mother got excited when she lifted the floor mats and there was mold/water damage. XXXX explained he didnt know how this happened. My mother went into the dealership and demanded the {$1000.00} check back. At this point, we were separated.XXXX kept telling me what deals he could make me, that were way out of my price range, not to let my mother boss me, ect. Several salesman and financial people were inside and refusing to give my mother back the {$1000.00} check without her looking at other vehicles, buying a vehicle herself, having me buy a different vehicle, ect. My mother explained very colorfully that she lent me the money for the check ( that is true ) and she wanted that check now. She got the check. I took my mother back to the bank and had to have Assistant Vice President, XXXX XXXX, destroy the loan for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nApproximately XXXX XXXX, I went to look at trading my car at another dealership. I had my mother with me. As we sat with the financial people at the dealership, it was discovered that XXXX XXXX paid off my auto loan with Santander on my XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX! My note to Santander was paid off by XXXX XXXX and the title of my XXXX was now titled to XXXX XXXX! XXXX XXXX OWNED my car that I was making car payments and insurance payments on. \\n\\nI took my mother down to XXXX XXXX. We spoke with XXXX XXXX who found everything funny and told me the only way out now, was to buy a car from XXXX XXXX. My mother was not amused and demanded to see someone to answer some questions. An elderly lady with blonde hair and wearing tacky leopard everywhere, came to see us. She explained that it was a small back office error, I could always buy a car at XXXX and it would be a seamless transition. My mother stated that was not acceptable. The elderly lady stated that since XXXX XXXX owned my car, that they could also re-possess it at any point and my mother may want to watch her tone. My mother stated she wanted to see the XXXX XXXX dealership owner, XXXX XXXX - her request was refused. \\n\\nSince that time, I have stopped into XXXX XXXX several times to speak with XXXX. I am told I can buy a car from them and save myself the headache of dealing with Santander. It is also always a joke about my XXXX XXXX not being repossessedyet! I feel that as a threat to buy from XXXX XXXX or else. \\n\\nI have sent 3 signed and notarized XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  forms to Santander to get the title in my name. On XX/XX/XXXX, Santander claimed to have the XXXX I sent, but, XXXX XXXX would not do their part whatever their part is. On XX/XX/XXXX, Santander called me to inform me that I never sent in a XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Santander and demanded that someone give me a live person and fax number that I could fax a XXXX. Later that day, I faxed a XXXX to XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Santander to see if the fax was received no one knew. \\n\\nI am at a loss of what to do. I am paying on and insuring a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX name and have been doing it for 6 months now. I refuse to be strong armed into buying from XXXX to escape the title issue. I am unable to transport my family all together at one time. My father is now XXXX from the transplant. My sister and I each work XXXX hours a week to help support the family. And..the car is ruining my life! \\nIf unable to attach the information, I have documentation to back up everything I am telling you, except for the in-person conversations with the elderly woman and XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'In XX/XX/2013 we purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, financing through Ally Financial. We signed a contract for 72 months. Little did we know, the vehicle had major manufacture defects. At approximatly 120,000 miles we started to notice excessive oil consumption. We began monitoring our oil level daily and took it to a mechanic who then advised us that XXXX had used cheap piston rings in the 2.4L engines and that our piston rings had gone bad and that the oil consumption would get worse. As the oil consumption got worse we took it to yet another mechanic who said the same thing and advised us the only option was to replace the engine because of major scarring and damage inside the engine. We are a family with one income and a XXXX  who is XXXX and has XXXX twice a week, we did not have the money to replace the engine. After speaking to several XXXX dealerships we found that there was a memo from XXXX about the problems but it was not a recall and only covered up to a certain amount of miles, at this point our only option would be to continue to monitor the oil level as XXXX was not offering a solution. By 150,000 the oil consumption had gotten worse, consuming about 2 quarts of oil a week. The vehicle became less reliable, started to loss engine compression, and became harder and harder to start. We contacted Ally to find out why they had changed the terms of our loan, only for them to claim finance charges. We asked if they could rewrite our loan and explained to them the problems we where having with the vehicle and asked to maybe lower our payments so that we could save some money and have the vehicle fixed. They where not willing to help. At this point we had no choice but to find a more reliable vehicle so that our XXXX did not have to miss XXXX or XXXX visits. At this point we have been left with no other options and no where to turn. Ally repossessed the vehicle after 61 days of non payment and will not give us any information as to their intensions, they are going to end up forcing us into bankruptcy because of the changes in the terms of our loan and their unwillingness to rewrite our loan. With the fact that Ally is unwilling to help us and XXXX will not take responsibility for their defect, we feel that we have been wronged by both and have been left with having to make a decision that will affect our family badly, but at this point we have no choice.',\n",

I met with the salesperson who I used to purchase the lease in XX/XX/XXXX to talk about what options I would have to buy the car. He told me he would have to submit the information for approval since I am retired and on a fixed income. Later on that afternoon he called me back and said that I got approved @ a 9 % interest rate. Later on I XXXX \" Interest rates on used cars \\'\\' and the current standard industry is around 4.5 %. The next day ( today ) XX/XX/XXXX I went back into the dealership to see if I could negotiate a more reasonable interest rate since I felt like they were gouging me. At one point during our conversation with the counter person who handles the loans the sales person looked at him as we were discussing the loan and said ... Isn\\'t the rate@ 9.5 %? Yesterday it was 9 % and today it is 9.5 %? We continued on for a while and the counter person said ... It isn\\'t us it is the main XXXX XXXX XXXX company that is setting the interest rate. A few minutes later we were still haggling and he said ... \\'\\' What do you want a point off \\'\\'? After that I started thinking if it was XXXX XXXX XXXX and not the Local Dealership were I was at making the decision on the interest rate ... Why would he be making that statement? He also mentioned that if I had a job he could get me a lower interest rate? Isn\\'t that discrimination in lending? Why should I be treated any different than anyone else? I have been in this lease almost 3 years and have never missed a payment. Also the counter person kept mentioning that it was them ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) not us setting the interest rate. I also have a credit score of over XXXX. So I just found this on XXXX ... \\n\\nAuto Loan Interest Rates | XXXX XXXX, a division of XXXX XXXX ... \\nXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, Term, Interest Rate, APR**. 740 & Above, 0 to 48 Months 0 % Down Payment, 4.00 %, 4.00 %. 740 & Above, 49 to 60 Months 0 % Down Payment, 4.25 %, 4.25 %. 740 & Above, 61 to 72 Months 0 % Down Payment, 4.50 %, 4.50 %. 700-739, 0 to 60 Months 0 % Down Payment, 5.50 %, 5.50 %. 650-699, 0 to ...\\n\\nAccording to the above I should get a 4 % loan w/a 750 or above credit score and my fixed income should not reflect the outcome of the interest rate XXXX XXXX wants to charge me. Also note the new car financing in the area is@ 0.9 % and 1.9 %. Hope you can help me with this as it saddens me that a reputable Corporation would want to gouge their customers just because they think that their behavior is appropriate.

They provided me with their \" new \\'\\' address, and I had the Credit Union reissue the check on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nTo avoid having my loan be sent to collections ( with Ally ) while I waited for the new check from my Credit Union to be received, I was told that it would be in my best interest to pay them now, and wait for reimbursement when the check arrived. I was then informed that I would not only need to pay for the month of XXXX, but that I would also need to pay for a previous month, that was now delinquent. When I pressed them to explain why I would need to pay twice within the same month, they told me that it was for the month of XXXX ( XXXX ).

At that point I called USAA and let them know there was still a balance on my XXXX loan and it appeared the payoff was never received by them from USAA. I was told at that time that they would reissue the check and take care of the issue prior to my payment due date on XX/XX/XXXX since I had already made my XXXX payment to USAA for the new loan obtained. \\nUnfortunately that is not what happened. Instead on XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a copy of the check that was supposedly cashed by XXXX. This check had no endorsement information on the front or back of the check that was discernible. \\nI opened a case with XXXX, provided them all of the check information and a copy of the check. They have been unable to locate it on their system. I have called both USAA and XXXX multiple times every week to try and resolve this issue, which is still unresolved. \\nUSAA finally provided me with a XXXX tracking number last week for the check. However that tracking number shows that the check never left USAA and was never received by XXXX. \\nSo I now have two loans outstanding against my one vehicle. Ive been told I need to make the payments on both loans since USAA is supposedly not responsible for my contract with XXXX, and that any fees/interest will be my responsibility solely. \\nEvery time I call USAA and speak with someone Im told itll be 3-5 business days for a response and yet we still are no further on a resolution and Im the only one being financially impacted in the interim.

Stating that {$210.00} was charged off??? and isn\\'t due till XXXX XXXX which would be my last payment. This is crazy I Made all Payments. \\nI Spoke with XXXX XXXX and she was not helpful, and for a week I got no repose. Then they fabricated a whole Story about how i was suppose to Pay off that Balance of {$850.00} with in 60days, then they said i had no GAP which I do.. when I said had \" no notice \\'\\' of this arbitrary 60 policy, she stated they wouldn\\'t remove it.

ACC of this loan as it was deleted off my online Banking for this reason. But i have the evidence. My Previous Credit Score Was XXXX This Damaged my Score over 75 points. All of this for no reason!! And they refuse to fix it. \\nAnd also the XXXX XXXX Lady had the audacity to try and collect the {$210.00} that never should of been charged off in the first and still not fix the charge off on my credit!!!! I will Pursue legal Action If this isn\\'t fixed.

That low rate was advertised on TV in the Washington, DC area. \\n\\nIn further review and speaking with CapitalOne Bank 's local CSR and Mgr., it was confirmed that by XXXX XXXX increasing by fraud, my interest rate, their criminally inflated processing fee of {$700.00}, while also fraudulently including the {$800.00} GAP and {$4000.00} Warranty, exceeded my approval for a different car CapitalOne was ap approving at {$39000.00}, not {$45000.00} at payments of {$450.00} instead of {$760.00}. \\n\\nSince XX/XX/XXXX, CapitalOne Auto Finance has repeatedly made excuses why it will not correct by refinancing my discovered illegally made RISC ; And CapitalOne has also ignored XXXX XXXX 's TILA and FCRA, consumer fraud It, CapitalOne Auto Finance knew, was [ made ] aware of, and both XXXX XXXX and CapitalOne had, thereafter, engaged in a criminal scheme to perpetrate against a consumer, consumer fraud conspiracy under Federal and State 's criminal Statutes and Codes, Laws, making it a crime for a bank to know of TILA, FCRA, contract frauds as demonstrated and shown by the facts and documented evidence. ( See. FTC v. Auto Dealer 's FRAUDS, XX/XX/XXXX ). \\n\\nAccording tto CapitalOne Auto Finance, their attorneys ordered and directed XXXX XXXX to cancel the first contract and rewrite the new contract with the removed illegal charges, interest rate and with the correct total of the loan not to exceed {$39000.00}, their maximum new car loan amount being {$40000.00}. \\n\\nCan your firm help me to have TILA and dealer fraud and consumer fraud criminal charges instituted against XXXX XXXX, its business manager, and owners who repeatedly have ignored CapitalOne Auto Finance 's directives to cancel and rewrite and that has since cost me more than {$4000.00} in excessive car payments, interest charges, and other charges that was incurred to keep my XXXX, excellent credit score. \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nRespectfully yours XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX\",\n",

His vehicle was finally repossessed on XX/XX/2021. \\nMy half sister had a STRONG interest in keeping the truck and trying to catch up previous missing payments. I have been trying to talk her out but she insists. \\nI have been labeled on his account through Ally Finance themselves as the \" informant \" on the account. Also my name is the one listed on my father \\'s death certificate. I also repeatedly told Ally on their recorded line \" please do not discuss any account information with anyone other than myself in order to perfect the privacy of the deceased \" they obliged. \\n\\nMy sister is pretty persistent so she kept calling trying to get payoff balance. And on XX/XX/2021 she calls me on 3 way with Ally Auto finance. They proceeded to give her the sensitive account information and I couldn\\'t stop it. They did not speak or get any verification info from me. And she was able to have the representative give her the account info with only the account number. They told her status of account as well as the charge off date. The only reason i didn\\'t cut them off was ti avoid personal conflict with my sister and other family members. \\n\\nThe reason I am filing this complaint is Ally Financial did not respect my wishes of non disclosure to persons other than myself. They also violated the law by talking this account info without going through proper verification. \\nThere was a reason I wanted this to stay discrete and now it\\'s causing distress among my and family members. Serious potentially dangerous distress. I am looking for all possible options at this point. \\nAcct name is under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and time of call was XX/XX/2021 around XXXXXXXX XXXX cst. Call took place on their recorded line. \\nMy name is XXXX XXXX the son and only informant authorized to discuss account info.',\n",

( I worked over seas at the time, so i was unable to retrieve any mail ). She did advise me of fees that were at the end of my loan that i would need to take care of ( late fees etc ). I asked her could i possibly make smaller payments towards those ( fees ) at a later time possibly XXXX $ per month and she said sure. At this time, Im am under the impression that my car principle balance is paid off, the title is in the mail and this car after 5 years is mine. I was aware of ( fees ) that i owe to this company for late payments and etc. but she told me the car principal balance was paid. On XX/XX/XXXX, my car was repossessed by this same company. I never received 1 call from them or letter but they picked my car up from my address. I was never made aware that my car was in any default status. I kept the same number for a year and it was discovered that during the course of that time i was not called. Im not sure if the representative intentionally gave me False or misleading information, however her negligence has cost me my vehicle and my financial reputation. I have been in contact with the company since the repossession and i have filed a complaint in this representative for her misrepresentation of my account. As a consumer, i feel as though my account was mishandled, i would have made a more educated decision if i was aware of the potential consequences of my account. In the year that this business took not reaching out and making me aware of my debt it caused detrimental damage. I pull my credit report regularly and this account stated closed as well as a zero balance online. This company should be held accountable for misleading consumers or not making sure their customers understand closing details and charge off statements.',\n",

Per the new lending institution I requested a Lease Buyout Packet,  however the Honda rep said due to security they could snail mail and/or fax it. I provided the new lending agents name and fax number requesting it be fax 'd to his attention. I reiterated my request and pertinent information, the rep said it would be sent out. This was done late morning on the XXXX and fully expected it to arrive by EOD on the XXXX and/or latest by morning of XX/XX/2020. I contacted the new lending institution on XX/XX/2020 to see if he had received the fax and he responded a negative but did verify his fax machine was operational. \\nI failed to get his name or identity and didn't ask the turn around time but did mention it was time sensitive since the we were intending to close this out prior to next required pay date. I went on XXXX XXXX   website to see if I could get the required information and did find a way to get a pay out amount and what date it was good to and I emailed that to the new lending institution but he said that info was not sufficient for his requirements and did in fact need the Lease Buyout Packet originally requested.\\n\\nI again called Honda Financial on XX/XX/2020 and again spent an inordinate amount of time >1 hour  waiting for a live pickup. This time I requested the support person 's name, XXXX, and explained to her what transpired the previous day and asked why the requested information was never sent. She had all of the right information, new lending agent 's name and fax number from yesterday 's call. I asked her how much time should be expected to get a simple fax out and she agreed it shouldn't be too long. I'm assuming it's an automated process. She said she would resend, I gave her the new lender 's direct phone number so she could validate it was received. She placed me on hold and attempted to call the new lender but did not receive validation. I subsequently emailed the new lender and awaiting feedback.\",\n",

I was like \" wait a minute that doesn\\'t sound right, I Just paid you. \\'\\' He couldn\\'t give me a straight answer of when it was and where I was behind. I have called to several times to get straight answers on all stemming from this one incident. I have been told 2 out of 3 times that they do not do automatic payment plans to someone else saying yes they do automatic payment plans. They have never informed me that they do online automatic payments through online banking. I have asked to speak to management only to be yelled at. This has been THE MOST unprofessional company I have ever had the displeasure to come across. All representatives have been inconsistent with company policy. I have been asking for over 30 days for a 10 day pay off letter which I am entitled to obtain, I am looking to refinance through another bank with a higher interest rate just so I do not have to do business with Wells Fargo. I have utilized my resources to obtain further assistance, Consumer Affairs counselor from XXXX XXXX XXXX was able to contact Well Fargo and spoke with XXXX supervisor of customer service. XXXX stated that she will email XXXX with the 14 day pay off and the payment history for the length of the loan for review. I would like to resolve this matter by receiving the 14 day pay off letter and for the lender to adjust my credit report history within the Fair Credit Reporting Act.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"Due to a family fall out, I am currently having to refinance my vehicle to get my father off of loan that he is a cobuyer on. I was told by the bank that is willing to refinance my vehicle for me that I needed to request a payoff from my current lender. Not an issue. I called them on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a rep who told me the only way I was able to get my payoff was to go into a local branch or make an online account and get it from there. I live in Arizona and originally got the loan financed through a bank in Georgia. So the closest actual branch to me was in Texas, I told the gentleman that. He said if that was the case that I would just have to make an online account and would be able to receive my payoff from there. Yes, I did mention to him that I needed it for refinancing purposes. Due to not having an email on file, he told me because my email needed to updated that it would take 2 business days to get my account set up. Due to needing to email me a confirmation that says my account is ready to be set up. He said to wait for an email and that's what I did and never received one. So I followed up yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX and they told me that the account was never set up. I was then on the phone with a representative for 32 minutes just trying to get my account set up - not that representatives fault, she was very helpful and informative. My sole complaint is about the gentleman that helped me on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX. I told him that I have never heard of it being so difficult to get a payoff for a loan, did not even offer to mail it to me. Nothing. It was frustrating because I work for a finance company myself and I know there are many ways to receive a payoff then what I had been told by him. I did not mention that I needed a payoff to the individuals that I spoke with on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, because I was just anxious to get online to get my payoff - like the rep from Thursday had told me. Once I finally got help with setting it up on Monday, I quickly logged on just to have a message online tell me that I needed to contact them if I wanted a written payoff. At that point I was absolutely upset. It's already stressful the situation I am having to deal with, let alone not even being provided the correct information prior to get this done the right way. I was also at work while trying to do this and having to go back and forth to get a hold of someone but the wait was constantly 50 minutes or more and when they called back, I was always on the phone at my own job with a customer to where I couldn't answer. I called later Monday night, still XX/XX/XXXX and at that point they told me the loan servicing department was  closed, which I thought that's who I had been dealing with the whole time, but at this point it just sounded like customer service. That rep provided me the number and business hours to call and speak with someone in regards to getting a payoff. I called this morning, Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, and the representative I had spoke with informed me that the easiest and quickest way for me to get a payoff since I am refinancing is to have the other lender fax in a document request with my name and loan account number. She said the soonest they would have it is 24-48 hours. At that point I finally got the answer I needed, but why didn't the representative that I spoke with on Thursday inform me of this? To save the time, the hassle and the absolute headache. I would have never had to make an account, I would have never had to wait on hold for 32 minutes to make my account and I am just really mad and upset that I was relayed the wrong information in the first place because I could have had the payoff to me by now, if not within the next 24 hours - I could have had the current lender that I am working with request it that same day on Thursday if I was told the correct information. I can not wait to be done with this company and really hope that a training opportunity is taken upon that rep so no one has to go through what I went through. Like I said, I work for a finance company, so I know how big of a deal this complaint can be and that's why I am making it known because it really did frustrate me and make it a struggle to get something so simple.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'I purchased a 2009 XXXX XXXX about two years ago. I financed the vehicle with US Auto Credit Corp. I recently began to have mechanical issues with the vehicle. The repair costs made it difficult for me to afford my bi-weekly payments. I reached out to US Auto Credit to inform them of the situation and to find out if there were any options available to help me reduce the financial strain to avoid late payments or defaulting on the loan. The only option presented to me was a forbearance. The forbearance wasnt a good option because it would have extended my loan term. The maintenance is going to be required more frequently in the future. The forbearance only provides temporary relief. At this point Ive made over 50 bi-weekly which totals close to {$10000.00}. The interest rate is 26 %. It would be close to impossible for me to pay the car off before it died. Since US Auto Credit didnt have any other options I had to look into refinance options. Luckily my bank approved the refinance but they would only approve {$6600.00} which is the value of the vehicle. I was told the payoff amount was around {$7700.00}. I would have to pay the difference. I didnt have {$1100.00} but I really needed to do this refinance. It lowered my interest rate, payment, and term by almost 50 %. I went back to US Auto to ask if they would write off a portion or reduce my balance. They sent me a settlement offer for {$7100.00}. The loan wouldnt be reported as paid in full but as paid in full- charge off less than balance. They also said that the would issue a XXXX for the any reduction amount greater than {$600.00}. I finally spoke with a supervisor XXXX XXXX who said there wasnt much more they could do. He advised me to continue paying on the car for another year ( {$4400.00} ) and try to refinance at the end of the year. At the end of our conversation he told me that he would have upper management look at it but he was almost positive that they didnt have any other options available. He said hes never seen them offer any other options for situations like mine in the 4 years of his employment. The companys mission statement says the want to help and treat consumers with fairness and dignity. My experience has been the complete opposite. I feel like this company is taking advantage of people with less than perfect credit. I dont feel like the lending practices are designed for you to successfully pay off a loan. And when you get into a situation like mine which I feel was created by their predatory lending practices ... they dont offer viable options to help. They relentlessly demand money and refuse to offer fair resolutions ... leaving you stuck or putting a person into a worse credit situation. I was young with poor credit and I needed a car. This company took complete advantage of that. The dealer made it seem like this company would be doing me a big favor by approving my loan because my credit score was low but I was actually being lied to and taken advantage of. I can only imagine how many people have gone through this and didnt know what to do.',\n",

When the 6 month mark came we tried to refinance the loan but were then told they we would not be able to refinance. We were told by the dealership specifically that they don\\'t help with refinancing, stating that \" refinances don\\'t make them any money. \\'\\' This was despite them telling us we would be able to refinance after 6 month \\'s. We then spoke with Capital One and they told us that they do not take their own refinance loans and we would not be able to refinance with them on our own, even though we were told we could do this by our dealership. We then had further discussion with the dealership and he stated he would help us but every bank he spoke with stated we would have to put more money down to refinance a loan. From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I tried to reach out to the dealership and spoke with them again on the XXXX of XXXX. From there we tried to see if I could get a refinance by myself without XXXX. They then asked for my paystubs and I sent those and waited for him to get back to me. On XX/XX/XXXX I messaged them again because I had not heard anything about my attempt to personally refinance. In my message I asked that while he was looking for a loan that he could find a loan that doesn\\'t have simple interest rates or high interest rates at all. He finally responded and stated we would speak the next morning on the XXXX. On the XXXX I then called and was unable to reach him and left a message. I never heard back from him until the XXXX of XXXX. XXXX stated that there was a bank holiday on the XXXX and asked me to reach out to him the following day. I reached out to him again on the XXXX and he stated he would call me some time in the afternoon. I then told him that was unfair because he stated he would call me first thing in the morning. He then stated he only would have five minutes to speak with me, he let me know that Capital One nor any other bank was able to approve my refinance by myself. During the initial purchase of the car we had already put down XXXX as a down payment but somehow that money can\\'t go towards a refinance. They are continually asking us to put down more money to refinance with no explanation as to why. So far within the loan \\'s life we have already payed XXXX and we still owe approx. XXXX. Nothing we have payed has gone to the principal of the loan and it all has gone towards the interest. No one is willing to work with us on this including Capital One.',\n",

Mailed it signature confirmation, but never signed for. I contacted Bridgecrest, told that was not the best/correct address for payoffs, was advised to cancel check, have new check sent to XXXX, AZ address. Did this on XXXX and new check arrived to me XX/XX/XXXX. In the meantime, received notice from Bridgecrest that loan was paid in full. Assumed they were able to process check before it was canceled. Received call on XXXX, check was returned unpaid. XXXX advised check not paid because it did cancel before they processed it, advised to send second check that I received XX/XX/XXXX. Sent that check XXXX  overnight, signature confirmation. This was signed for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. Received call XX/XX/XXXX, payment late, they haven't received/processed check, a FULL month after check signed for! Received emails about late payment, repossession. I was assured that it was being taken care of, that my account was on a hold status so that nothing would be reported to the credit bureaus. On XX/XX/XXXX, Bridgecrest responded to my XXXX  complaint that my account was paid in full, everything back dated and closed. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another email saying my account was past due and that was the last day I could pay without being reported. I again reached out to my POC, XXXX, who didn't contact me back until XXXX and told me that the second check was returned Insufficient Funds! I knew this was a complete lie. I went to the credit union first thing the next morning where I was able to get a photo of the processed/paid check and the electronic transaction record. I sent her this proof and the next time I tried to log in to the Bridgecrest portal, it said I no longer had an account. I was fine with that, thinking this mess was finally over until I got notification that my account was reported as 60 days past due to the credit bureaus!!! This company is completely incompetent and extremely deceitful. I have tried contacting them multiple times to get them to clear this up with the credit bureaus and I have disputed the reporting myself, but the damage is done! My credit score has dropped over 100 points!! They need to be held responsible for everything that they did, or really everything that they DIDN'T do!\",\n",

Incredibly, the salesperson neglected to pay off either of the two vehicles. Hyundai Motor Finance, the lender, started making robo calls about the payment was late. When we called, we were assured the payments were up to date. We discovered the problem when a payoff letter was sent that had late fees on the XXXX XXXX and two payments remaining. The dealership admitted their error and finally corrected the credit reporting issue on that vehicle. \\nThe second vehicle, a Hyundai XXXX, was paid off in XX/XX/2020. Then, the account was found to have late fees of {$190.00}. Hyundai Motor Finance reported us 30 and then 60 days late on a PAID OFF loan. I paid the late fees when notified in XX/XX/2020 ; however, at that point the dealership should have taken responsibility for not including all fees in the payoff and not passed that charge on to the customer. \\nThis is for a customer who has a nine year history with the dealership and finance company. Now, 18 months after the fact, we are refinancing and the two late payments are affecting our ability to get a low interest rate. Repeated attempts to get the dealership to provide a letter stating the facts and how the error was their fault have gone unanswered. I have the original documentation to prove this but the credit bureaus want the creditor to verify the account history.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'Hello, I had my car refinanced through XX/XX/XXXXback in late XXXX. In early XXXX, a payoff check was sent by XXXX and XXXX ( new lender ) to Bridgecrest to payoff my loan. Bridgecrest received the check on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX and XXXX noted they had the wrong amount sent on XX/XX/XXXX, so they reissued a new check with the correct amount and put a stop payment on the 1st check. Bridgecrest received the 2nd check and proceeded to sit on the check until XX/XX/XXXX when they finally attempted to cash it over a month after receipt. XXXX and XXXX sent a 3rd check that was received on XXXX XXXX by Bridgecrest. That to this day, Bridgecrest has failed to apply to my account. During this time, I was not notified that the checks weren\\'t cashed. As I received an update on my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX. That stated my Bridgecrest account had been closed. However, on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX, I received a call from Bridgecrest stating that they needed to speak to the new lender due to the checks having some issues and they wanted me the customer to contact the new lender for them. I obviously was unable to speak to anyone at XXXX  or XXXX  due to the time I initially received the call. I suggested to XXXX that, they normally make contact with the lenders with regards to checks and that has nothing to do with me so I advised they continue to try to contact XXXX  or XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my vehicle was repossessed without warning. When I spoke to Bridgecrest they stated it was due to lack of payment, which made no sense as I hadn\\'t been notified that my vehicle was at risk of repossession. I think made several attempts on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX to resolve the situation with XXXX along with XXXX involved in the matter with no avail. As Bridgecrest, constantly was stalling telling me that there was no one that could verify the check being received back in XX/XX/XXXX, yet I was never given an option to speak to anyone who had knowledge on fixing the situation. I was constantly referred to having to \" wait \\'\\' until a manager can resolve the issue. However, here I am 9 days since the repossession and no further along in getting a clear understanding from Bridgecrest. The only thing I\\'m told it\\'s my fault to keep the account current, which has no standing since the account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX, but yet reopened by Bridgecrest. This company received a payout 3 months ago and this issue is still not resolved. Bridgecrest is without a doubt the most incompetent and fraud ridden finance company in existence.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'On the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX an alleged contract was made with Navy Federal to refinance a XXXX XXXX, XXXX. At this time, a check with Navy Federal was not received. The XXXX XXXX XXXX was financed under XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I was hit by two vehicles causing my car to be totaled. XXXX took possession of the vehicle on XX/XX/XXXX. I called and spoke with a Navy Federal Member Service Representative. I informed the representative that my car was totaled so there was no need to move forward with the alleged agreement. I told her that I no longer needed the check I was supposed to pick up from my XXXX XXXX. The Representative informed me that it was still in my best interest to obtain the check and send it to XXXX XXXX XXXX regardless of the condition of my car. During that phone call, we arranged for said check to come in the mail using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The check was delivered XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX received the check XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX was fully aware that my car was damaged before they check was sent out. Taking the advice of the representative has caused me problems financially. Im unable to use my Navy Federal account. Navy Federal has added two past due payments to my account, they have added late fees and they also charged my savings account {$20.00} because Navy Federal was not listed as the first lien holder. Now, Im dealing with late fees, and harassment from Navy Federal trying to collect an alleged debt. The first alleged payment was due XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by XXXX insurance adjuster stating that the value of the car was {$16.00}, XXXX. XXXX has the check and has been ready for almost two months to send the check to Navy Federal. Ive communicated to Navy Federal on numerous occasions that I will not be making payments on a car that is no longer in my possession, especially since there is a check ready for Navy Federal. Navy Federal needs to do what is required by XXXX to obtain the check. If Navy FederaXXXX didnt take over the alleged payments from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the car would have been paid off almost two months ago. \\nSpeaking with a Lawyer, looking into my options, I found that there were violations made by Navy Federal on the alleged contract/promissory note. These Violations voids the alleged contract. According to the Promissory note, Navy Federal follows the Truth in Lending Act.\\n\\nIn the Truth in Lending act, under Title 15 U.S. Code 1605, the Finance Charge in connection with any consumer credit transaction is the SUM OF ALL CHARGES. That includes late fees and lien fees from any title company. According to the contract/promissory note with Navy Federal XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is {$3100.00}. According to the Truth in Lending Act and the Federal Law, {$3100.00} is the only amount Im allegedly responsible for paying if this wasnt a consumer credit transaction. Also, under Title 15, 1605 ( 5 ) ( B ), Navy federal did not include insurance in the finance charge. XXXX insurance was charged separately. Also stated under U.S. Code 1605 ( b ) ( 1 ) and I quote charges or premiums for credit life, accident, or health insurance written in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be included in the finance charges unless the coverage of the debtor by the insurance is not a factor in the approval by the creditor of the extension of credit, and this fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the person applying for or obtaining the extension of credit ;. This statement proves that I am the Creditor extending credit to Navy Federal.\\n\\nNavy Federal pointed out in the Returned Loaned Payment Fee section of the alleged promissory note that under ( Section 1014, Title 18, U.S. Code, makes it a federal crime to knowingly make a false statement. Navy federal has willingly and knowingly BROKE THE LAW!\\n\\nPursuant to Title 18 U.S. Code 8, the term obligation or the other security of the United States, includes all Federal Reserve bank, Federal Reserve notes, bills, coupons, checks, drafts for money, certificates of deposit and, etc. This alleged debt under alleged promissory note is to be the obligation of the United States not the consumer. \\nPursuant to 12 U.S. Code 1431 banks can not loan money.\\n\\nPursuant to Title 15, U.S. Code 1635 ( 4 ), the Right to Rescind shall apply to all consumer credit transactions. The Right to Rescind was not included on the Promissory Note. Navy Federal NEVER sent me documents to Rescind. Again, you broke the law. According to the CFPB, 1026.23 ( f ), the Right to Rescission is only exempt to refinancing by the same creditor. \\nAccording to CFPB 1016.7, and Title 15, U.S Code 6802 ( b ) Navy Federal was supposed to provide a form of opt out notice to consumers. Navy Federal has never sent a form of opt out notice, via email, mail, or electronically. I am demanding that Navy Federal remove the account from all three major credit reporting agencies. That includes, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. \\nAccording to CFPB, 1026.13 Billing Error Resolution, I extended credit to Navy federal with my credit card under an open-end consumer credit transaction. So, there should not be monthly bills or monthly payments. When Navy Federal ran my social security number ( credit card ), alleged promissory note was paid in full. If Navy Federal claims this alleged loan/promissory note came from their Account, I demand that Navy Federal provides me with proof of the Accounting Ledger and, Im demanding proof of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principle ( GAAP ). This will determine if this alleged debt exist and is owed to Navy Federal. \\nI am specific in what Im demanding. Do not send a copy of the alleged Promissory Note. I have that document in my possession. Provide me with what I asked for exactly. If Navy Federal doesnt provide the documents Im demanding, Navy Federal satisfy the loan account as Paid in Full. Navy Federal also agrees to provide Paid in Full documents so the lien placed on the title of the XXXX XXXX XXXX is removed. \\nPursuant to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Title 15 U.S. Code 1692j ( a ) It is unlawful to furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer. Navy Federal has furnished deceptive forms illegally in the attempt to collect an alleged debt. Each law violated is a {$1000.00} charge owed to me. \\nPursuant to Title 15, U.S. Code 1692g, I as the consumer have a right to validate this alleged debt.\\n\\nPursuant to Title 15 U.S. Code 1692c. ( c ) I am notifying you in writing that I REFUSE to pay this alleged debt. I am demanding that you cease all ILLEGAL communication with me through all mediums. \\n\\nPursuant to Title 15 U.S. Code 1692c. ( c ) ( 2 ) I am invoking my specified remedy as a consumer, and as the original creditor. I am demanding all the following : 1. ) Remove Navy Federal Accounts from ALL consumer reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). Documentation needs to be provided. \\nXXXX. ) Send Accounting Ledger AND XXXX documents by mail AND via email. \\nXXXX. ) Close the LOAN account as satisfied and paid in full providing proof of payment. You do not have permission to close my checking or savings account. \\nXXXX. ) Return the {$20.00} taken from my savings account to satisfy the lien on the title. This was taken without my permission. Breaking the Federal Law voids contract/promissory note. \\nThe CFPB, among other Entities will be receiving this letter, including the documents I want to upload with my complaint. Failure to comply, will result in Litigation. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, By law, I requested that this consumer credit transaction be disputed and that further interest be stopped. Navy Federal broke the law, denied my dispute and is currently reporting negatively to my consumer credit report. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I just received an email from my XXXX Account letting know that potentially negative information from Navy Federal is reflecting in my account which caused me to lose XXXX points. According to the FDCPA, while a dispute is in process, the company is not allowed to update any new information. Navy Federal deliberately ignored my request and broke',\n",

I received the buyout statement ; I read XXXX 's terms and it seemed very straightforward. Bank of America was the lender for the loan. I went to go add BofA as a Lien holder to the title which I received this week. None of the documents showed that any taxes had to be paid in one document that I received from BofA, there's no mention of the taxes.

It's only in the fine print that I may have to pay a tax, but there was no disclosure made to me what the taxes would be and nor was given the option to have those taxes included as part of the loan. Now I am stuck with paying out of pocket {$2000.00}. This is an unfair and nontransparent practice. Transparency was not afforded to me.

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"Beginning of last month, I called Ally Financial XXXX to get a loan to payoff my lease. I informed them that my nephew and I were looking to submit a joint application because he is in need of a vehicle and is building his credit, but he has never obtained an auto loan. \\n\\nWe provided all of our personal information ( ssn, income, addresses, etc. ) asked by the Ally representative. The Ally representative then said that if we were to get a loan jointly that I would be required to be on the auto insurance policy which I am not sure why that mattered. At this point, I felt reluctant to go any further with the application because we were not calling Ally for information on auto insurance coverage. However, my nephew was still hopeful and anxious, so we continued with the application. During the call, I told the Ally representative he was wrong because as long as one party ( borrower or co-borrower ) is listed on the Title they can get sole auto insurance coverage. The Ally representative placed me on hold to check if what I said was legit only to return to the call to tell me I was right which was a complete waste of our time. Thereafter, the Ally representative asked a series of questions pertaining to the amount we were looking to finance ; he was able to pull the payoff amount for my lease directly from Ally 's system he said, then he asked if we would like to include a down payment which we said yes, roughly {$2000.00} or {$3000.00} is what I believe we stated. The Ally representative did indicate that a down payment was not required, so we asked for preliminary figures for both ( down payment and no down payment ). My nephew and I determined that putting money down was the best route based on our financial needs and told the Ally representative that we would like to move forward. The Ally representative read a lengthy disclosure about pulling our credit that required us to give our consent in order to proceed which we did. The Ally representative stated he would submit our application to underwriting for review, he said they ( underwriting ) will review our credit and income to make a credit decision. I did mention to the Ally representative that my neighbor bumped into the passenger door while the car was in park and the vehicle is scheduled to get repairs in late XXXX because that's the soonest XXXX XXXX could find an appointment slot in our area. \\n\\nA few days later, the Ally representative called back asking me if I would like to get a loan without adding my nephew and he was alluding to me proceeding with the application as a straw purchase which by definition, is an illegal transaction as I had clearly explained our loan purpose upfront. The Ally representative asked if my nephew has credit established and my response to him was to pull our credit reports and see for yourself as I thought that was the whole purpose of gathering our information for underwriting 's review. The Ally representative said they at Ally didn't want to do a hard credit report pull only to find out that my nephew doesn't have enough credit to prove loan worthiness and the pull would lower our credit scores, like they were doing us a favor. \\n\\nI felt so disgusted and discriminated against because none of the expectations that were stated upfront nor the terms and conditions explained in the verbal disclosure ( s ) actually took place. To this day, we never received a declination letter from Ally nor was our credit report ever pulled. To my understanding, this is a Regulation B violation. From the start of the call, it seemed like Ally was looking to find reasons to not submit our application and/or intimidate us to not move forward with pursuing a loan with them and I never missed a payment with Ally. We provided our information in good faith and under the impression that the application process would be seamless. \\n\\nToday, I got a letter in the mail from Ally stating to turn the car in or they'll recover it. I called the phone number provided on the letter and I have to pay for a lease extension until the car repairs are completed and have agreed to keep the vehicle insured at least until the repairs are completed, but I am not happy with Ally at all.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"I initially filed a complaint against Drivetime  XXXX    XXXX   and during this time I have communicated with them and have discovered some things I believe are illegal and frauduently. During my talks with Drivetime I discovered they put out a repossession out for my vehicle the same day they received my complaint which I believe is in retaliation and in violation of Illinois  Consumer Fraud Act. 815 ILCS 505  and makes them liable for damages. Drivetime has behaved in a way that businesses should not behave when dealing with legitmate comcerns or complaints. During this time it was revealed that my account was sold and Drivetime no longer was the creditor of my account and they have yet failed to disclose who has my account. I have security alerts and fraud protection on my credit as I 'm in the process of trying to rebuild my credit and know that hard inquiries can be very negative as they are an important part of your credit. Upon receiving an email alerting my to a change on my report I 'm quite shocked to discover that Drivetime has pulled my credit report resulting in a hard inquiry. I have not given Drivetime permission to pull my credit or any authorization to do anything with my credit and cause m y credit score to dr op. Since I have filed my complaint against Drivetime they have and are continuing to do illegal and frauduently activities to retaliate against me and have made themselves liable for any legal actions that will allow me to remedy this situation. Hard inquiries generally occur when a financial institution, such as a lender or credit card issuer, checks your credit report when making a lending decision. They commonly take place when you apply for a loan, credit card or mortgage, and you typically have to authorize them. The Fair Credit Reporting Act and some state credit reporting laws set forth the basic rules that protect your credit information. These laws allow only certain entities to gain access to your credit report in certain situations. They also restrict how your credit information can be used. Sometimes individuals and businesses pull your report when they have no legal basis to do soand this is called having an impermissible purpose. If the person requesting your credit report does not  have one of the  permissible purposes, then your credit report is off limits. If you believe that somebody wrongfully pulled your credit report, you may be able to sue them in state or federal court for damages. I have fraud alerts set in place that if any activity occurs on my account I 'm notified and any application for credit the company must contact me to take verification steps. I do n't know how Drivetime was able to pull my credit report as I was not trying to obtain any form of credit with them and I have alerts in place. Drivetime is being very malicious in the ways they have repeatedly handled this situation since I 've filed my disputes. Drivetime has come up with their own set of rules that are invalid or did n't exist prior to me filing a complaint. In pulling my credit report Drivetime was to use my information as an unfair advantage in negotiations. In violation of the FCRA I 'm entitled to damages including punitive because Drivetime is deliberately trying to use illegal and fraudulently tactics when trying to come to a settlement regarding this complaint. Consumers should n't feel threaten or fear when filing a complaint against a company out of fear they may face repercussions. I felt threaten and it was an intimidating experience when talking to Drivetime regarding my vehicle as I was repeatedly told that if I did n't meet his terms they would put out a repossession for my vehicle. In filling my complaint I was hoping to get a resolution and not have my life invaded fraudulently, repossession, and causing harm to my credit as I try to rebuild something that is so sacred.\",\n",

Hasnt covered any of the cars issues that they claim are not covered, but when I call the warranty company they are. When I signed the paperwork I asked before signing why is there 2 amounts on the document, they assured me I was paying the XXXX. The listing price for the car was that much, I got approved and then at the last minute when I was finished signing the paper work the lender they said that approved me changed there mind. They then magically found Santander USA and charged me 25 % casual interest. Now Im paying XXXX for a car thats worth XXXX if that anymore. I didnt want the car at that point and they told me that I couldnt get out of the contract due to signing it.

It took them months to finally get me the needed proper documentation to legally show Im owner of the property. I just need help refinancing. I dont feel it was within my constitutionally protected rights. I never agreed to be financed thru Santander. But the I was scared into believing when they said even if I broke the contract and ended it, I would still owe for the loan on the car.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"On XX/XX/XXXX I was asked to co-sign/borrow for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX from XXXX XXXX. As this is a subprime loan the APR is 20.58 %, {$11000.00} finance charge, making the {$15000.00} financed, that amount includes {$290.00} for Gap Addendum Waiver into {$27000.00} total. We had signed a contract earlier in the week for a XXXX that was {$5000.00} less but XXXX XXXX XXXX turned down that loan but approved the higher loan. \\nI told the sales manager that I did not want to get into a loan with over {$11000.00} in interest, that is a whole other car and I am on Social Security XXXX  and not comfortable with being responsible for it. The manager came in and assured me that the loan could be refinanced without me after a year of good payments, but what he did not say is no one will refinance a car that is over 10 years old and it turned 10 a  week after signing the contract. If I had known that fact I would have never put myself in this kind of debt. \\nOn XXXX XXXX a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX stated that the payment from the dealership on behalf of your addendum has not been received. And it is their understanding that the payment will not be sent. And the dealership would be responsible for the Gap waiver should there be a total loss. \\nAfter paying for more than a year and a half on XX/XX/XXXX we went to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they gave us a XXXX that we did not see, showing an accident report that we were not told about and potential odometer rollback indicated and they would only give {$3000.00} in trade. \\nI tried to call the dealership but they had closed down by then. On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint with the OCCC and they closed it without sending me any of the proof, I asked for them and in the documents XXXX sent on XXXX XXXX was an inspection for the car dated XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX miles and on XX/XX/XXXX dealer inventory on my XXXX shows XXXX and I have an odometer disclosure with XXXX. From XXXX through XXXX there is a XXXX mile difference. \\nAlso they sent a document that says Gap Addendum Waiver that we have never seen. The information shows the car as NEW and msrp as {$60000.00}, and the signature of the borrower is a forge, you can clearly tell the signature looks like the sales manager who signed next to it. The name is spelled wrong and the numbers for the date is not how either of us right, I am not even on it but I drive the car. With it came a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to whom it may concern there is an active policy, when I pulled the policy up it is just a typed document not signed and dated. \\nI started calling XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX asking what the odometer reading is on the title because we have still have not received a receipt and she asked me, don't I know how many miles my car has, I said I want the miles OFF the title and she said they didn't have it there and to go to the DMV. \\nBy XX/XX/XXXX we were getting a letter from First Investors Financial Services saying we were to pay them now. On XX/XX/XXXX I did a title search and on titlecheck.us the NMVTIS vehicle history report shows the mileage as exempt, and the Power of Attorney we signed can not be used if the car is subject to federal odometer disclosure statement. The application for Texas title does not show exempt it has mileage and the county of title issuance the dealer filled out. I sent a complaint to DMV on XX/XX/XXXX and the investigator said the miles were just typos by the inspection stations and the business closed so they can't do anything. \\nI contacted First Investors Financial Services in XX/XX/XXXX and asked the same question about mileage with no response. I finally sent emails to the higher ups and explained the situation and that the sale is void under Texas Transportation code chapter 501 sec.501.073. He asked me was I wanting to voluntarily surrender the car, no I do not, this is no fault of ours and my credit is excellent now and will not except it on my credit and our remedy is to have the contract cancelled and they take the car.\\n\\nHe said they disagree and the car is exempt because it is 10. As I told him, the car was 9 when we signed the contract and that they have a copy of the odometer statement and the title receipt they sent me shows miles as N/A. There has been no reply in 2 weeks. \\nI am afraid they are about to do as XXXX and sell my contract and I have to go through more. \\nI know there is a violation of the DTPA, Texas Transportation code, Texas Financial code, Federal Odometer Act, Business and Commerce code. Stallion lied to the OCCC. And they sent the OCCC a bill of sale from the auction and they paid a little over {$8000.00} but I am paying {$27000.00} for the same car! And it does not matter if I pay early they are charging more finance charge each time, which my contract says the finance charge would be less. \\nWe just want out of something we would have never gotten into if not for being led by the manager. We have already had to replace the transmission and the headlight twice in the first year and have paid 3 years on a car with no clean title.\",\n",

The first buyout check was sent in XXXX, was not cashed and therefore after a month a stop payment was placed on that check. Another check was sent to them on XXXX and I have confirmed receipt on XXXX from my refinance company who has the tracking information from XXXX that it was delivered. I am told that the hold up is because my refinance company hasn't issued a new check which is false. I also was contacted by Bridgecrest to inform me that the check was received and that there was a {$140.00} or so difference between the check and the actual buyout amount which I paid over the phone and was told that my account was resolved. You can even see on my loan payment history that the buyout check was applied and then removed and further late fees were assessed after that happened as well. My refinance company tells me that they have a number of clients that this very same situation is happening to with regard to refinance from Bridgecrest specifically and frankly it feels like retaliation for refinancing my vehicle. I need this issue to be resolved with no detriment to my credit. I am being fed contradictory information from my original financer ( Bridgecrest ) and my new financer company ( XXXX XXXX ) is very frustrated at this situation as well as they are dealing with a number of accounts experiencing this exact issue.\",\n",

This is in direct contradiction to them telling me someone was going to contact me within 1 to 2 business days. \\n\\nI have {$130000.00} yard decoration that I can not legally tow on the roads in the state of Florida due to no tag being issued. I can not operate the boat on the waterways due to no boat registration being issues by the state in my name. \\n\\nI have repeatedly asked to speak to a manager when i call the XXXX number and the agent on the other end has just flat said no. This is unacceptable! \\n\\nThe title documentation company is selected by Bank of the West therefore they are the parent company and should take immediate and corrective action to get there own customer the documents needed for the vessel.',\n",

Lending Club said that they can not change the due date of the first payment. I have been lied to by their customer service reps as they told me that the first check was lost and a second one was sent out on XX/XX/XXXX. I confirmed with another customer service rep, that was not true and no second check had been sent out. I was told by a another customer rep that an extension could be done on the first payment, which was another lie.

After a hard inquiry on my credit, I was informed that I was approved and given my new monthly payment along with APR. I was told to check my mail as I would receive correspondence that way and to continue to make normal payments. After a few months I had not received anything nor did I receive emails or phone calls. On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Wells Fargo to inquire about the delay. The first representative \" XXXX \\'\\' informed me that Wells Fargo was no longer exercising refinance options for customers and that I should take my business to another financial institution. I asked to be forwarded to a supervisor and upon transfer was hung up on. After calling back, I asked to be transferred to where they were attempting to transfer me to which was the escalation department. After a brief transfer and a long pause, someone answered the phone with the greeting, \" hello \\'\\' without identifying themselves. I explained my situation and stated my desire to have the hard inquiry removed from my credit since my refinance was not going to be honored. The escalation employee told me that I needed to write someone else within Wells Fargo despite being forwarded to the correct department able to handle my inquiry. The representative seemed to have had the impression that it was my fault that my refinance did not work out despite myself being informed by the previous representative that refinance options ceased on XX/XX/2020, which meant I was only given three days to respond to correspondence I never received. The escalation employee informed me that they attempted to call my cell phone but only got the busy signal. I find that hard to believe as my cell phone is always on me and always on therefore they would have never gotten a busy signal and I do believe this was an error on their part as they have the correct mailing address on file for me.',\n",

About 6 months ago the car was totaled so we started the process of getting our payout as Capitol One owed us about {$4500.00} due to the car being worth more then our loan amount. I was working with my insurance company ( XXXX ) to get the payout but the day the agent was coming by to give me the check she said there was a problem with the bank, meaning Capitol One. We had a rental but that was limited to 30 days so at the end of that I needed to empty my saving account to buy my wife a car in cash. Come to find out Capital One had never received the perfected title because they failed to submit documents. I have called them every week for these 6 months now to see if there is anything they need to make sure we can get this issue resolved. They are quite incompetent because every time I call the person says they will send and email to the back people to see what the holdup is but nothing ever comes of it and I just end up calling the week after to get the same response. They forgot basic paperwork that is needed to register a car in their name. Once they forgot the Title Application, then they forgot to get the old registration from me before submitting paperwork. They tried getting a release of lien and failed at that so I stepped up and called my old lender to get things sorted. They were able to provide a release of lien but then it was back to Capitol One. Most recently I submitted a document and have been waiting 4 weeks for them to resubmit the document \\'s to the XXXX but I am always told they are in \" review \\'\\' even though it is simply an old registration. At this point Capitol One owes me over {$6000.00} as I have still needed to make payments on the car. I am here to try and get them moving because I could really use that money and I feel they are either ignoring my case or are just that bad at their job.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"After purchasing the XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX, XXXX DE in XXXX of XXXX, I agreed to lease the vehicle with American Finance Company. After test driving the vehicle, I noticed that they had the air conditioning blasting in mid- XXXX. The car drove great, and there were no indication lights on. After driving it off the lot, I turned off the air. In two days, the engine light came on, and so I took it back to XXXX Co. The mechanic stated that there was a small part on the engine the size of a pea that was bad. I had a warranty on the vehicle. American Finance immediately stated that I had to take the car to their service station. Which I did. After a week or so I picked up the vehicle. Soon after, American Finance called and stated they needed to place a device inside of the car. Right after that, I drove the car, and there wasn't any light on, and then a few weeks later, the engine light came on again. I called the warranty station, and they stated that the warranty had expired. I took it to auto zone, and they stated something about the coolant pack, and that they couldn't read the codes. I took it to a mechanic, and they took the car apart, and still couldn't find what was wrong with it. I kept putting coolant in the car, and nothing worked. By this time, I had already paid American Finance XXXX, and the car total was XXXX. I told them several times, after purchasing the vehicle that something was wrong with it, and that their company didn't fix the car. They stated, 'well that really your problem. The car would break down in odd places, and frequently. American Finance picked up the broken car with my things inside. While at their gated facility, they broke the window in my car, and some of my personal items were stolen. They called me the next day, and told me about it. I asked them how did someone break a window in a tightly secured gated parking lot? They gave their apologies, and stated that they would repair the window. I also find this to be criminal. At the end of the story, I requested the remaining balance to be voided due to the car being a lemon. They then harassed me afterwards, and stated no, youre going to pay for the vehicle, as they sent garnishment for my wages. I believe the company intentionally sold me a car that wasn't any good, and that they also didn't fix the car, after I took it to their repair shop. I'm asking the courts to diminish the wage garnishment, and void the remaining balance on the vehicle. I will be pursuing this further as I believe, that they intentionally sold me a vehicle that wasn't operable. Attached I have a receipt and picture of the XXXX XXXX diagnoses, and also the reference from the mechanic that service the vehicle. To add to the evidence, I had asked American Finance if I could have one last mechanic take a look at it, and they stated, '' absolutely not. If someone could please look into this matter, as I have been harassed by them on a constant basis. They are charging me judgment fees, and interest, which totals XXXX 'm asking the courts to delete this payment to {$0.00} due to them selling me a car that was a lemon, and not operable, and not fixing the car. Also, for criminal activity that they performed while the vehicle was in their procession. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX vs American Finance, LLC Thank you.\",\n",

I dont understand why I owe them this amount if they told my bank i owed them {$13000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and they paid of my account with them. There information was misleading not only to me but to my bank. Im now stuck with still owing them and im paying my truck to my bank.',\n",

XXXX has records showing the check was mailed in plenty of time, but TD Auto has been unwilling to work with me and waive the {$44.00} fee. XXXX XXXX has said that do not waive these fees. Then they said they can not. Then finally they said that they just don't want to. They have me over a barrel for {$44.00} on a {$70000.00} loan and are unwilling to work with their customer. They have also been unwilling to expedite this account updating on my credit report and unwilling to provide me with a letter showing this has been paid off. My mortgage broker wants this to show as paid off & closed on my credit report to boost my score a few points and secure me a better interest rate. I may end up paying a higher interest rate because TD Auto does not care about their customers.\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': '1. I have been a customer with Honda Financial Services/AHF since XXXX. This is my 3rd auto loan with the company.\\n\\n2. I began the refinancing process in XX/XX/XXXX and was approved by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I received a payoff check from them to sign and send to American Honda Financial, which I did. \\n3. My payoff check was sent to American Honda Financial XX/XX/XXXX and received XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the refinancing company, that the check was then cashed on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n4. I received no contact from Honda Financial until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with Customer Service XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She informed me of what happened with my payoff check - that the account number was not present on the check and that because the last name on the check did not match the last name on my HF account. She informed me to send my marriage license to XXXX, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a confirmation email or phone call that my marriage license had been received via email. NOTE : It was during this time that myself and my husband tested positive for XXXX ( I have proof of positive test results if needed ) and were in quarantine. I was very sick and my mobility was limited ). \\n5. I had a payment due with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I made the payment to them as I assumed that everything would be resolved with Honda Financial, they would apply the payoff amount and I would be fine moving forward. \\n6. I got a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX from HF indicating that my acct was still past due. I spoke to the representative XXXX and told her about the ongoing issue. She was the first to inform me that the marriage license had NOT been received. I re-sent it that day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to XXXX with attention to XXXX. \\n7. I looked into having to pay my monthly note to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX y, and the loan balance was {$0.00}. This was on a weekend so I had to wait until at least XX/XX/XXXX to speak to customer service from AHF. \\n8. I spoke with XXXX for the first time the week of XX/XX/XXXX. She was very pleasant and helpful. I wanted the issue resolved. We had an extensive conversation where I expressed my displeasure with the way the incident had been handled as well as the lack of communication to XXXX, the consumer. She acknowledged that someone in her department should have contacted me and apologized for the lack of communication and that she was going to make sure everything got resolved for me. XXXX expressed frustration because the marriage license that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX was not processed and used to update the last name on my account. This was not communicated to me by the Customer Service Representative XXXX that received the email on XX/XX/XXXX. Also, my marriage license was the only document I\\'d ever been asked to send in. If additional information was needed to update my last name, no one ever told me. XXXX told me that she was \" Just going to put it through \\'\\' and assured me that my last name had been updated. I trusted that she would help. \\n9. I was also informed from XXXX that American Honda Financial sent back the payoff check from XXXX XXXX. I remember this because she remarked that it was odd they paid themselves off \" with their own check. \\'\\' 10. XXXX instructed me to speak with the refinance company and give her a call back. I told her I would. I asked for her direct number so that I wouldn\\'t have to go through customer service and to get the matter resolved more efficiently. She was unable to provide a direct number. I did inform her that I was still behind and very busy catching up with work and other obligations after recovering from XXXX but I would do my best to get back to her quickly. \\n11. NOTE : From my first time speaking with XXXX, I only spoke with her as she said she would be handling the issue for me. There was no conversation where XXXX ever indicated that I needed to make a payment to Honda Financial to avoid repossession. No customer service representative indicated that their calls were an attempt to collect a debt or that my account was that delinquent.\\n\\n12. I spoke with XXXX XXXX the week of XX/XX/XXXX. I was sent documentation from them showing proof that American Honda Finance had not sent back the payoff check as XXXX reported to me. Instead, they created a whole new check to send to XXXX XXXX. XXXX had previously informed me that XXXX XXXX paid themselves \" with their own check. \\'\\' As it turns out, this was FALSE. It must be noted that XXXX XXXX received this check from AHF AFTER I had emailed my marriage license to AHF so that they could apply the original payoff check from XXXX XXXX to my account. \\n13. I attempted to contact XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but was unable to call during AHF business hours due to the difference in time zones. I planned to call the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, but my child was sick and I was unable to call. \\n14. The morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I came outside to my car being completely gone. Thinking it was stolen, I contacted XXXX who informed me that car companies are supposed to inform XXXX Police that a car is being repossessed. The car had not been reported as repossessed to the police, so I moved forward with a police report and statement. I called to speak to XXXX during business hours and she will no longer take my call. I also spoke to other customer service representatives, who told me to contact the Recovery department to handle my issue, but did not give me the phone number for the Recovery Department. The communication and customer service ( up to my first time speaking with XXXX ) has been XXXX XXXX. \\n15. At no point in any conversation did XXXX ( or any other representative ) ASK if I was able to make a payment or that a payment of a certain amount was needed to get the account current. She made me feel as though everything would be resolved. I thought the process was simply to get my name updated on my AHF account so that AHF could receive the funds from the original payoff check and complete the refinance process. If I had known my car was in danger of being TAKEN, I would have done everything I could to prevent this from happening.\\n\\n16. My credit has now been RUINED beyond repair and AHF is at fault.\\n\\n17. This whole situation feels EXTREMELY predatory, as if AHF wanted to keep me locked into a high car note/high interest rate so they botched my refinance and now that my credit is destroyed, I am stuck with them or without a car. I am reporting all of this to the CFPB and XXXX.',\n",

After 30 days I called and they said it could be 45 days, after that, 60 days. Then they said it was \" under review, could be 90 days, the check would be mailed by Friday, and the check was in the mail, etc etc. \\'\\' I have called multiple times, always told a different story, passed around to managers and supervisors, and now we are at the point that when we call, we are put on hold and no one returns to the phone.My husband and I have talked to everyone that they will let us talk to at Chrysler Capitol, spend hours and hours on hold, being transfered to various people, and no one will help us. We have financed 2 vehicles with Chrysler Capitol were good customers, never late or defaulted on any payments, this was just a mistake on my part. Why would they not return that money? Please help us.',\n",

The bank rep XXXX gave me the payoff of {$1000.00}, so I paid it in full. One minute later XXXX stated I had a remaining balance of {$64.00}, so I paid that balance. XXXX congratulated me for paying off the car and said it should take 6-8 weeks to receive my title. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo because It had been 5 months and I still had not received the title. I was transferred XXXX at the office of the President she stated that I still had a balance of {$270.00}. and 3 days earlier they charged -off my loan. I was furious, I insisted I did not want that on my credit report and paid it in full. XXXX took the payment over the phone during that call, I gave her my debit card acct number paid {$270.00}. \\n\\nXXXX stated that my car loan was reported late 4 months and the charge off was reported to the credit bureau. That is UNFAIR! I want that reporting fixed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I returned to the XXXX Branch and requested to speak to the branch manager, however XXXX XXXX is covering for Branch Manager XXXX XXXX. \\nThe office of the President in Arizona employees XXXX and XXXX the researchers for Wells Fargo wanted statements from bank employees who assisted me. So, XXXX XXXX the Branch Manager stated XXXX did remember congratulating me on paying off my vehicle, but that\\'s all she recalled. \\n\\nI finally received my Title/Pink Slip and the date issued was XX/XX/XXXX. That date is relevant because the XXXX week of XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo reprocessed my vehicle due to a bank error. I had made my payments at that time via telephone and received confirmations for all my payments. My payment was {$500.00}. and I carried a floating balance of $ XXXXSo there was no reason the funds shouldn\\'t have been released. \\n\\nWhen they repossessed my vehicle I honestly thought my car had been stolen.

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'The short version of my complaint is that I firmly believe that XXXX/Ally purposefully refused to return my phone calls to complete the approval on my lease buyout loan so that they could turn around and deny it after the original approval expired. I firmly believe they are being discriminative towards me for a reason that I am still trying to figure out. They have continuously misled me and they have dragged this process on for almost two months now. I also firmly believe that they are either discriminating against me as a person or if not they are purposefully dragging out this process so that I owe them lease extension fees once they completely deny the loan. Here is the longer explanation of the last two months : Back on XX/XX/XXXX I decided to purchase my lease at the end of the contract. I went through all the steps that day with XXXX XXXX at XXXX/Ally to apply for financing. He took down all of my information and went over all the steps and the process. He said it would take a day or two to get the approval back and we ended the call. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from XXXX/Ally called me back to tell me that the loan to buy out the lease was approved and he said he was initiating the online portal for me where I could go in and drop all of the documents needed such as pay stubs, etc. I verbally accepted the offer and a day or two later I uploaded all of the needed documents to the online portal. It was after then that all of the trouble started. All of a sudden I stopped receiving phone calls from XXXX/Ally and when I would call to follow up they would just tell me that everything looks good and I have done all that is needed. In a few days I should see the closing documents online for me to sign. They offered to mail them but I said online is best for me. A few more days went by and I heard nothing so I called in again for an update at which time I was told that someone named XXXX was my new loan consultant and they transferred me to her. XXXX gave me the same info, that the process will take some time but assured me the loan was approved and they were working on drawing up my closing docs. Yet again a few more days passed with no communication from XXXX/ally and there were often times I would call and could not even get though to a loan consultant because of high call volumes. I would never let more than 3-4 days go by without following up with XXXX. Now we are at X/XX/17 which is when I decided to record all of my phone calls and communication with XXXX/Ally as I felt they were deliberately not returning my phone calls for whatever reason. I called in on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told I needed to speak to the credit department to verify some information. I was transferred to the department and they simply asked me to verify some basic information. The gentleman said he was going to transfer me to a loan consultant now but they were busy so he would have someone call me back by noon on X/XX/17. X/XX/17 at XXXX comes around and there is no phone call from XXXX/Ally. I called in later that afternoon to ask for an update and I was transferred to XXXX XXXX who said there was strangely no loan consultant assigned to my file. I told here I was working with XXXX and then XXXX but XXXX said that she would just take in my file to finish it up since she can see its been a long process. She said the loan was approved and she could see that I already uploaded all of my documents to the portal. She would work on finishing up my file and get the closing docs drawn and then call me the next day to update me. XX/XX/XXXX No call back from XXXX/Ally again so I called in again to ask for an update. XXXX no available. I continued to call in every couple of days only to be told that a loan consultant would call me back soon. I eventually asked to speak to a manager because im never getting a call back when im told that I would. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX which is when XXXX XXXX finally returned my phone call. She told me that she is prepping the closing docs and I would definitely see them on the web on a few days and that she would follow up with me. She apologized for the bad communication and blamed it on the fact they are really backed up and its a separate dept that draws docs. XX/XX/XXXX Im still waiting for the closing docs and a call back from XXXX. I am being patient since she said they are really backed up. I get a call today from a customer service rep who says. Your loan has been approved and we would like to talk about the offer that we have for you. I said OK but I already had an application approved so he transferred to XXXX, who I had worked with once before. She told me that it was a duplicate loan and to just ignore it and that she would delete it. She confirmed she could see the original loan in the system and that everything was fine. I asked her to email XXXX XXXX to call me back when she could. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX calls me later that day and says Yeah I had to redo the loan but it was no big deal and she would call me back as soon as she is able to correct the duplicate loan issue. She promised me that she would call me back in two days or less. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX calls me back ( First time she/XXXX/ally has ever returned my phone call ) and she told me that She received an answer back from the lender ( ally ) and the application was denied. I immediately got upset and told her that the loan was already approved and when I talked to her last week she was drawing closing docs as if the loan was already done. After asking more questions XXXX finally revealed that the original application that was approved had expired and she had to submit a new one and that one was denied but could not tell me why. I immediately asked to speak to a manager who  said they would look into the file further. He said he would call me back by EOD on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX No phone call back, of course, so I called in and explained the situation only to be placed on hold for 40 minutes. I could not wait so I hung up and called back on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX Called in and I was told the person I talked to, XXXX, worked in the CA office and they were not in yet. The rep was sending an email to him to have him call me when he got in. XX/XX/XXXX Never got a call from XXXX so I called in asking for an update and another manager told me that they were working with Ally managers to clear up the issue and they would call me back in a day or so. XX/XX/XXXX No phone call back again So I called in and spoke to XXXX XXXX who said the app was declined. I asked for more information as I was confused why, after all the issues, he was just simply saying its declined. I was asking for more information and he was very vague and would give me zero information on the decline. I asked him why would it be approved on the original application and not on the second application that I didnt know was being submitted. I mentioned that I had no idea my credit was being ran again and that I did not give permission for that credit pull. He just kept being very vague and dodging my questions. He did says he would start some fires and find out what changed to cause the decline. He mentioned I needed to contact ally to find out why it was declined. XX/XX/XXXX Called the lease buy out dept at ally and gave a short version of my issues and that I was directed to call them. The lady was very confused and said there was nothing she could do and she was unable to answer my questions. She was confused why XXXX divison would tell me to call an ally department directly because there is just nothing she can do. She was drafting an email to upper management on the issue and said I would receive a call the same day, if not the next business day. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Currently still waiting for a call back.',\n",
